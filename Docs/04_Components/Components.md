# Text

## Overview

Text variables are used to store single characters or strings. When the stored data is a number, it is also stored in text form. These variables can perform various operations on the text they store, including but not limited to adding characters, deleting characters, extracting characters, generating random strings, and searching for characters. Text variables greatly enrich the ability to manipulate and manage strings in applications, flexibly meeting the needs of different scenarios.

## Usage Scenarios

Text variables are often used in situations that require frequent string processing, such as text editors, input boxes, and string operations in data processing workflows. For example, when designing a form that requires user input, text variables can dynamically store the user's input information and perform validation and processing.

## Core Functions

The core functions of text variables include:

- **Store Characters**: Capable of storing single characters or complete strings.
- **Operational Functions**: Can perform string operations on text content in various ways.
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Can dynamically change stored content through assignment operations.
- **Search Function**: Provides the ability to search for specific characters and output their positions.
- **Random Generation**: Can generate random strings.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Variable Assignment

In edit mode, the initial value can be entered directly in the variable attribute "Value" field. By default, the value of the text variable is empty. If you need to assign value in non-edit mode, you can dynamically assign it through the "Assignment" action or data binding.

### 2. Text Variable Operations

Text variables support various operations on their content, including adding characters, deleting characters, extracting characters, generating random strings, and searching for characters. Basic operations are similar to common string operations.

## Advanced Usage

Text variables support various advanced string operations, which can enhance their processing capabilities when combined with basic usage:

- **Add Characters**: Characters can be inserted at specific positions to flexibly adjust string content.
- **Delete Characters**: Selected characters from specific positions or characters can be deleted to manage string content.
- **Extract Characters**: Extract partial content from text to effectively utilize text information.
- **Generate Random Strings**: Generate random strings of specified types and lengths to increase string diversity.
- **Split Strings**: Split strings based on separators into multiple parts for segmented processing.

# Number

## Overview

Number Variables can be used to store numerical values, with basic types including floating-point numbers (decimals), integers, etc. The source of the value can either be a determined number or derived from a formula that results in a number. Number Variables can perform operations on the values they store, including incrementing by 1, decrementing by 1, generating random numbers, and generating random integers.

## Basic Usage

### Assignment of Number Variables

1. **Direct Assignment**:
   - In edit mode, an initial value can be directly typed into its "Value" attribute, defaulting to 0.

2. **Dynamic Assignment**:
   - In non-edit mode, variables can be dynamically assigned values via the "Assign" action or through data binding.
   - Dynamic assignment and operations can be performed by calling the following actions:
     - Assign
     - Increment by 1, decrement by 1
     - Generate random number, generate random integer

### Operations on Number Variables

Number Variables can perform operations on the values they store, including incrementing by 1, decrementing by 1, generating random numbers, and generating random integers. Their basic operations are similar to "Counters."

- **Generate Random Number**: In certain number-drawing scenarios, the method of generating random numbers with Number Variables is used. By setting the range for random numbers, each event trigger will execute the action and assign the current value of the Number Variable to the generated random number.

# Boolean

### Overview

Boolean variables in JavaScript are of the Boolean type, and they can only have two states: true or false. They are primarily used to determine the truthiness of a value. The use of Boolean variables in a project helps to improve maintainability, especially in situations requiring truth-value evaluation. Although text or numeric variables set to 0 or 1 can also achieve Boolean judgment, it is not intuitive. Therefore, it is recommended to prioritize the use of Boolean variables in design.

### Usage Scenarios

Boolean variables are suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Data Binding**: When a property itself is of Boolean type, such as a "visibility" option (visible or invisible), Boolean variables can be used for data binding.

2. **Event-Driven Style Changes**: For example, events like mouseover/mouseout or click can lead to style changes. In this case, Boolean variables combined with ternary expressions can be used to adjust styles.

### Core Functionality

The core functionality of Boolean variables is to determine and represent the truthiness of a state. Basic operations include assignment, toggling values, and setting specific Boolean states.

### Basic Usage

#### Property Data Binding

When the type of a property is Boolean, it is recommended to use Boolean variables for data binding. Examples include:

- "Visibility" option: It only has two states, visible or invisible, so Boolean variables can be used for binding.

#### Style Setting

Boolean variables combined with ternary expressions can be used to set styles. For example, the background color of a button can be changed based on the state of a Boolean variable when the mouse hovers over it.

### Actions

| Action Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Print Current Value | Call the browser console to output the current value of the Boolean variable for monitoring changes. |
| Assign Value        | Assign a value to the Boolean variable. Non-null, non-zero, empty object, empty array are true; otherwise, false. |
| Set to true         | Set the value of the Boolean variable to true.               |
| Set to false        | Set the value of the Boolean variable to false.              |
| Toggle true/false   | Change the value of the Boolean variable to the opposite state. |

### Events

| Event Name  | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Change | Triggered when the value of the Boolean variable changes, only fires once when the actual value changes. |

### Attributes

| Attribute Name | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value          | The state of the switch corresponds to the value of the Boolean variable, on is true, off is false. |

### Extraction Notes

- When performing assignment operations on Boolean variables, be mindful of the assignment rules: non-null, non-zero values will be considered true, while null, undefined, 0, etc., will be considered false.

### Further Reading

# Array

## Overview

Array is a data type with a logical structure as a linear table in a single row and multiple columns. Each "cell" is an element, capable of storing different types of data such as text, numeric values, images (in resource address form), colors (in color code form), etc. When accessing the elements of an Array, they are accessed in the form of "arrayName[index]", with the index starting from zero and incrementing sequentially.

## Common Functions

Array has a variety of functions, which can be better utilized by pre-declaring the data type. When not declared, the system will automatically match the data type based on the input content.

### Usage Scenarios

Array is widely used in various occasions that require linear data structures due to its simplicity and storage flexibility.

## Basic Usage

1. **Assigning in Edit Mode**: Assign values to an Array by editing data through the properties panel. This can create new data positions and specify data types, such as text, numbers, pictures, colors, etc. Click "+" to create a new data position; double-click the header to rename it; click "×" in the upper right corner to delete a data position; click the data position to input data.
2. **Assigning Values in Non-Edit Mode**:

   - **Set a Value**: Assign a value to an element by index.
   - **Add Value/Multiple Values**: Add one or multiple values to the existing data, the specified position can be the beginning or the end of the array.

### Referencing Array Values

1. **Reference by Index**: Select the array in the formula editor, and reference it by "[N]" (N is the index number).
2. **Random Value**: Retrieve a random value from the array for output.
3. **Get Maximum/Minimum Value**: Get the maximum/minimum value from the numeric elements in the array.

### Sorting

1. **Sort by Specified Method**: Sorting methods can be selected as ascending/descending alphabetical order, ascending/descending numeric order.
2. **Reverse Order**: Reverse the order of the array.
3. **Random Order**: Randomly sort the elements of the array.

### Search and Delete

1. **Search Value**: Search for the target value in the array, return the index number if it exists, otherwise return "-1".
2. **Delete Specified Value**: Delete all elements that match the target value.
3. **Delete Value at Specified Position**: Delete the value at a specific index.
4. **Remove Duplicates**: Remove duplicate elements, keeping only the one with the smallest index number among each group of duplicates.

# Object

## Overview

The object variable is a single-row, multi-column variable that can be referenced by key name. It can be seen as a one-dimensional object array, but actually, it is a variable. Object variables are very important in the VisualLogic tool, and their icon is located in the components bar on the left side of the editor.

## Usage Scenarios

Object variables are widely used in different scenarios, such as applications that require dynamic management and handling of multi-column data.

## Core Functions

Object variables provide a rich set of features to ensure flexible data manipulation, mainly including: assignment, deleting fields, adding fields, modifying field names, setting a field value, setting multiple field values, cloning structure, etc.

## Basic Usage

### Assignment

There are three main ways to assign values to an object variable:

1. **Edit Data**: Select the object variable, click Edit Data, and you can create the required fields one by one by clicking the “+” button.

2. **Import Structure**: Select the object variable and choose the structure of the required database.

3. **Direct Assignment**: Directly assign the value of the object variable to the current object variable.

### Action Instances

1. **Delete Fields**: You can delete unnecessary data columns by selecting fields.

2. **Add Fields**: Allows adding new data columns by specifying key names and default values.

3. **Modify Field Name**: Change the key name of the field.

4. **Clone Structure**: You can clone the structure (column names and types) of other object variables to the current object variable.

# Object Matrix

## Overview

Object Matrix and two-dimensional arrays are essentially arrays, but their elements and referencing methods differ within the tool. The elements of an Object Matrix are objects, while a two-dimensional array is referenced by index. For an Object Matrix, elements can be referenced by key names, and its element entry and functional attributes are fundamentally the same as a two-dimensional array, but it has no default rows and columns.

## Basic Usage

### Data Import and Structure

In an Object Matrix, import structures are often used to bring data from a backend database to the frontend. By importing the database structure, all fields in the database will become fields in the Object Matrix.

### Data Operation

1. **Assignment and Modification**
   - Data can be manually entered or assigned to an Object Matrix from a generic variable.
   - The assignment of columns and setting column names are critical for subsequent operations.

2. **Column Operations**
   - **Add and Remove Columns**: Columns can be operated on by deleting unnecessary ones or adding new columns, but if no default value is set, the column will not appear in print.
   - **Fill Columns**: Data is filled into columns by column number or column name.

3. **Row Operations**
   - **Add Row Data**: The position where data is added can be specified.
   - **Delete Rows**: Data is deleted by row number, noting that the row number starts from 0.

4. **Data Query and Statistics**
   - **Sum and Average Statistics**: Statistical operations can be performed on one or more columns.
   - **Search Function**: You can find the location of specific values in the array.

### Advanced Functions

1. **Clone Structure**: The structure (column names and types) of another Object Matrix can be cloned into the current one.

2. **Sorting**: Rows can be sorted by a specific column, either numerically or alphabetically in ascending or descending order.

# Time

## Overview

Time variables are tools used to handle time and convert it into the required time structure. They play a key role in the recording, display, and adjustment of time data, facilitating flexible and dynamic settings and adjustments according to user requirements.

## Basic Usage

### Adding and Assigning Time Variables

1. **Add Time Variables**  
   In edit mode, time variables can be added through the interface options.

2. **Assigning Time Variables**
   - **Manual Assignment**: In edit mode, you can directly input the initial value in the "Date" attribute, which defaults to the current time.
   - **Dynamic Assignment**: In non-edit mode, dynamic assignment can be performed through the "Assign" action or data binding. Assignment methods include:
     - **Assign-Timestamp (milliseconds)**: Only supports timestamp format; other formats will use the default time.
     - **Assign-(Year/Month/Day/Hour/Minute/Second)**: Accepts individual time units as input parameters to set the variable value.
     - **Assign-(YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS)**: Uses a formatted string for assignment.

### Invoking and Clearing Time Variables

3. **Binding (Invoking) Time Variables**
   - After assignment, the time variable can be invoked at any time.
   - In addition to the currently assigned time, adjacent times can also be invoked to achieve more functionalities.

4. **Clearing Time Variables**
   - After performing the clearing action, the value of the time variable resets to the default value when missing, usually the current time.

# Excel data processing

## Overview

The Excel Component is a data component in VisualLogic, primarily used to convert Excel files to object arrays or two-dimensional arrays within VisualLogic. Although the Excel Component itself does not store data, it can upload Excel files and parse them into object arrays or two-dimensional arrays, or export these arrays as .xlsx Excel files by invoking various methods.

The Excel Component is typically used to export data acquired from the frontend or upload existing local data to the frontend via Excel, followed by service calls to submit the data into a database.

## Core Features

1. **Export Data to Excel File:** Methods in the Excel Component can export specified arrays to Excel files, automatically triggering the browser's download window.
2. **Import Data from Excel File:** Supports reading data from Excel files and parsing it into object arrays or two-dimensional arrays.
3. **Custom Export Configuration:** Using JSON configuration files, you can customize the style and content of the exported Excel file.

## Basic Usage

### Exporting Excel Files

1. **Property Settings:**
   Before exporting files via the Excel Component, you can set various properties through the properties panel, such as the exported file name, header row height, column width, content row height, and whether to download images.
2. **Invoking Export Method:**
   Invoking the "Export Array to Excel" method will start the browser’s download window. Even without setting any properties, the export can proceed with default parameters.

### Importing Excel Files

1. **File Selection and Upload:**
   Invoking the "Import Excel File to Array" method allows you to choose an Excel file for upload and retrieve the file content in the callback. The file content will be split into the header and the main data body, typically assigning the main data body to a VisualLogic variable.

### Custom Export

In addition to basic export settings through the Excel Component, you can perform more detailed customizations via a JSON configuration file, such as merging cells, setting colors, fonts, etc.

Example JSON:

```json

# Data Wrap

## Function Overview

The Data Wrap is a virtual container whose sole purpose is to help organize the structure of the object tree. The Data Wrap can be added to the front-end or back-end. We can consider the Data Wrap as completely "transparent" during application runtime; it does not add extra elements during application rendering, and its role is limited to organizing the object tree during editing. Generally, there are two common ways to organize: placing objects of the same category in the same Data Wrap, or grouping objects into a Data Wrap according to page regions/functions. The purpose of this is to better organize the object tree structure for easier subsequent updates and maintenance.

## Use Cases

The Data Wrap is mainly used to meet the needs of structure organization in the development process of complex applications. Especially in projects with many components, using Data Wrap can effectively classify and manage similar nature objects, preventing a chaotic object tree and enhancing the maintainability of the project.

## Core Features

- **Transparency**: During application runtime, the Data Wrap does not add any extra elements, ensuring no additional load during rendering.
- **Structured Organization**: Helps developers manage the object tree structure more clearly, supporting grouping objects by category or function.
- **Flexible Application**: The Data Wrap can be added to the front-end or back-end as needed, focusing its role on management during the edit phase, whether for visual presentation or logical processing.

## Basic Usage

1. **Category Management**: All button components can be placed in one Data Wrap, and all text box components in another, making it easy to focus on the relevant Data Wrap when modifying a specific type of component.
2. **Area Grouping**: According to page layout, navigation bar related components can be placed in one Data Wrap, and components for the functional display area in another, and so on, facilitating independent adjustments in different regions."
# API

## Overview

API components are the unified entry point for initiating HTTP network requests in VisualLogic, categorized into front-end and back-end APIs. Front-end APIs are used to initiate network requests in the browser. When the application is released as a mini program, native application, or desktop application, the VisualLogic system will automatically access the native layer interface to implement network request functionality. Back-end APIs are used on the server side to initiate network requests, generally needing to be invoked in back-end services and handle the returned results. When back-end APIs are needed in the front-end UI, a back-end service must first be created to implement the back-end API invocation logic, and then the service is called within the front-end UI.

The advantage of front-end APIs is that the request logic is entirely handled by the client, making operations simple, saving server resources, and enabling quick returns. However, in scenarios with high-security requirements, direct front-end requests may be at risk of being hijacked or forged. In such cases, back-end APIs provide greater security assurances. Additionally, many APIs have cross-origin restrictions that must be bypassed through back-end requests to avoid cross-origin errors. When choosing between front-end or back-end APIs, the security of the request and cross-origin support should be considered comprehensively. If there are no issues, front-end APIs should be preferred; otherwise, use back-end APIs.

## Use Cases

Front-end APIs are suitable for simple operations that require quick returns, while back-end APIs are appropriate for scenarios that require additional security or handling of cross-origin restrictions. In some cases, open services without a UI can be created to directly invoke back-end APIs within the service.

## Core Features

### API Usage Process

The basic usage process for both front-end and back-end APIs is roughly the same:

1. The initiator makes an API call, triggered by UI components on the front end, such as a button click event; on the back-end, it is triggered by services or timers.
2. The API component sends a request to a third-party server.
3. The third-party server receives the request and returns the result.
4. After the result is returned, subsequent logic is processed by the client or server.

### API Configuration and Debugging

- **Request URL**: Specify the URI address of the third-party API, supporting absolute or relative addresses. For HTTPS front-end API debugging, an HTTPS address must be used.
- **Request Method**: Includes calling methods (such as GET, POST) and timeout settings.
- **Request Parameters**: Includes header and body parameters configured according to the API documentation requirements.

After the API configuration is completed, it can be debugged in the properties panel to view and parse the returned results.

### API Invocation

After configuring and debugging the API, it can be called in the event panel, specifying request parameters and obtaining the API return results in the callback block.

- **Specification of Request Parameters**: Default values can be overridden and URL parameters can be dynamically added.
- **Obtaining Return Results**: Refer to original return results, obtain reasons for request failures, request duration, etc.

## Basic Usage

Using front-end APIs, API calls can be initiated through button events in the event panel, and results can be handled. Back-end APIs are suitable for complex requests, with invocation logic defined in the service.

### Example: File Upload

To upload files via FORM-DATA format, select FORM-DATA type configuration and use it according to the upload return value type.

# Connection (socket)

## Overview

The Socket component can enable information transmission between multiple devices. Common application scenarios include real-time data sharing between applications and interaction in multiplayer games. In the message transmission process, Sockets ensure that users can send and receive information in real time, thereby guaranteeing the real-time capabilities of the platform or application.

## Use Cases

- Data Sharing and Synchronization: Suitable for applications that need to share and keep data synchronized between different devices or users.
- Real-Time Interaction: Sockets play an important role in scenarios requiring real-time interaction, such as multiplayer games or online meetings.

## Basic Usage

### Preparation
Before using Sockets, it is usually necessary to register the current user by setting user ID, nickname, and avatar information. This helps the recipient easily identify the sender when processing information. However, the user CID is the unique identifier used internally by the Socket.

### Sending Global Messages
1. **Event Trigger**: Send multiple global messages including message names and content by triggering specific events.
2. **Message Reception and Processing**: Upon reception, the messages are stored in the message data; you can manually input the message name to retrieve the content.

### Sending Room Messages
1. Create a room and set the room ID and maximum number of participants.
2. After joining the room, send messages within the specified room. Only users in the room receive the messages, and follow-up processing is performed through the "Room Message Received" event.

### Sending Private Messages
1. **Obtain User CID**: The current user CID can be obtained through registration or connection success event.
2. **Sending and Receiving Private Messages**: Specify the CID and send the message; the recipient retrieves and processes the message content through the "Private Message Received" event.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Connections
Using an external WebSocket connection address, you can customarily establish, disconnect and send/receive messages. During these operations, proper handling of parameters and response results is required when sending and receiving messages.

## Properties

# vFor

## Overview

vFor components allow dynamically generating UI unit modules with the same structure and event logic at runtime. These modules can include layout class components, UI class components, and variable class components. By binding a data source, you can dynamically control the number and attribute values of these UI units. vFor is often used in conjunction with conditional containers to create dynamic lists in a modular form, optimizing project management, reducing project complexity, and better meeting dynamic needs.

## Basic Usage

By utilizing vFor, developers can set UI units as sub-objects of the vFor components. vFor components generate the same number of UI units based on the specified data source, such as a two-dimensional array or an object array. The layout will be determined by the positioning environment of the vFor components. For precise layout, you can bind X and Y coordinates.

### Example Explanation: Creating a Vocabulary List

1. **UI Unit Extraction and Object Addition**
   Each entry is a UI unit, containing an English word and its corresponding Chinese explanation.
2. **Data Source Editing**
   Use an object array to store entry information, where each row corresponds to a UI unit and each column to an attribute of the UI unit, such as Chinese and English.
3. **Binding Data Sources and Attributes**

   - Bind the "data source" of the vFor components to the object array.
   - Bind the "content" of the Chinese and English text components to "current data1.Chinese" and "current data1.English".
4. **Operations Between Objects Within the UI Unit**

   - Use checkboxes and text components to create a list of answer options within the UI unit.
   - By setting event logic, both clicking the text and checkboxes can change the state of the checkboxes.

## Attributes

| Attribute Name      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Source         | Sets the data source for vFor, which can be one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays, generic variables, object arrays, etc. |
| Render Optimization | When enabled, only the UI elements corresponding to modified data will refresh, not the entire list. |
| Content Reset       | Default is off; it retains modified content when switching pages. When enabled, it resets vFor to its original state. |

## Actions

| Action Name   | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Get Data      | Retrieve specified data.                              |
| Set Data      | Set the data source for the for loop.                 |
| Validate Data | Check if the data meets format and type requirements. |

## Extract Attention Points

Objects outside of UI units created by vFor cannot directly manipulate the attributes of objects within the UI units. To change the attributes of internal objects, you can interact through internal objects, bind external variables, or modify the data source.

## Further Reading

Developers can optimize modular lists of vFor with conditional containers. For complex data binding, you can use the built-in method list of component variables to process the data before binding. When using nested vFor, ensure proper binding of fields related to "current data" or "current index", and accurately select rows and columns when using multidimensional arrays."
# vIf

## Functional Overview

The vIf is a tool for dynamically creating objects at runtime based on specific conditions. Its main function is to determine whether an object needs to be loaded based on the set conditions, equivalent to conditional binding of the object's "visible" property. In UI design, the vIf allows for intuitive use of multiple filters without complex ternary expressions.

## Usage Scenarios

The vIf is often used in conjunction with loop creation components to implement dynamic UI unit filtering and classification. For example, you can filter certain application instances based on two conditions: "Backend technology" and "components."

## Basic Usage

The vIf can be used independently to achieve dynamic creation or skipping of objects, and it can also be used in groups to achieve a one-of-many effect (such as if / else-if / else-if / ... / else).

**Example**: When the content of an input box is ≥60, display "Pass", otherwise display "Fail."

### Step 1: Adding Objects

Add two vIfs, two text components, and one input box. Set the content of the two text components to "Pass" and "Fail" respectively.

### Step 2: Editing Conditions

Set the conditions for the two vIfs. If the condition is met, the corresponding text component will display the respective text content.

## Advanced Usage

In scenarios where dynamic lists are created in loops, using the vIf can filter out UI units that do not meet the conditions. For example, filter student information from a gradebook where the score is >80 and the position is "class representative":

### Step 1: Adding Objects

In the Frontend directory, add a loop creation component, a vIf, a row component, three text components, and an object array. Place the vIf on the outer layer of the UI unit.

### Step 2: Editing Data Source

Edit the object array to set the data source.

### Step 3: Bind Data Source and Properties

Bind the "data source" of the loop creation component and the "content" of the three text components.

### Step 4: Editing Filter Conditions

Set the filter conditions in the attribute panel of the vIf.

**Alternative**: Without using the vIf, use the "filtered output" of the object array for filtering, and then use the filtered object array as the data source for loop creation.

## Attributes

| Attribute Name | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Condition      | Judgment formula, loads elements when the condition is met. |

## Extended Reading

The flexible use of the vIf can significantly enhance the dynamism of UI development, suitable for application scenarios that require multi-condition filtering. Developers can create complex condition judgment logic based on project needs, using the vIf as a foundation."
# Action Group

### Feature Overview

The action group component is located on the right side of the editor, alongside events and action groups. An action group consists of multiple actions, encompassing a series of target objects and actions. By packaging repetitive logic within the project into an action group, complex logic can be invoked more easily, reducing project complexity and enhancing maintainability. Proper planning of the packaging level of action groups can clarify the main logic of events and improve the readability of project logic.

### Use Case

For example, the logic for WeChat login and retrieving and assigning user information can be placed in an action group named "WeChat Login." This action group can be invoked during Frontend initialization or triggered by other events.

### Basic Usage

1. **Action group without parameters**  
   This is the most basic use of an action group, encapsulating a group of reusable actions within an action group that neither receives nor returns parameters. For example, all actions for initializing a page, including retrieving the time, clearing each input box, and resetting data, can be encapsulated in an action group.

2. **Action group with parameters**  
   If data processing is involved within the action group, raw data can be passed into the action group as "receiving parameters," and the results can be returned as "returning parameters" when the action group ends. For example, converting Unix timestamps to common formats, where the timestamp is the receiving parameter and the processed date-time is the returning parameter. The returning parameter assigned in "Current Action Group - Set Return Result" can be referenced in the action group callback.

### Advanced Usage

#### Synchronous and Asynchronous Action Groups

Action groups can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous calls, the action block after the action group waits for the current action group to complete before execution; in asynchronous calls, the subsequent action block executes immediately after the action group starts. Asynchronous calls can prevent subsequent action blocks from being blocked by the action group.

**Instance Comparison:**

- **Synchronous Action Group**: Turn on the "Synchronous" switch in the action group panel to make the action group directly return the string "Synchronous Action Group."
- **Asynchronous Action Group**: Keep the "Synchronous" switch off, making the action group wait for two seconds before returning "Asynchronous Action Group."

Through event logic editing, the asynchronous action group does not block the execution of the subsequent "Synchronous Action Group" and "Application System" action blocks. The string returned by the asynchronous action group will be printed to the console last.

#### Multiple Returns and Interruptions

Typically, only one "Set Return Result" statement is needed within an action group. If there are multiple return statements, in synchronous calls, the action group interrupts as soon as it executes a return statement for the first time; in asynchronous calls, the action group executes all return statements that meet the conditions.

- **Synchronous Call Example**: Turn on the "Synchronous" switch in the action group logic, and the result of the first loop will be returned immediately, interrupting the action group.
- **Asynchronous Call Example**: Turn off the "Synchronous" switch, and the action group will sequentially return "0," "1," "2," and "10."

## Attributes

| Attribute Name       | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Receiving Parameters | Variables received and used internally by the action group. |
| Returning Parameters | Variables returned after internal operations are completed. |

## Actions

| Action Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invoke Action Group | Select and invoke other action groups in the event panel.    |
| Set Return Result   | Set the return parameters for the current action group and end the current action group. |

## Events

| Event Name    | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| callFuncGroup | Start executing actions within the action group. |

## Extraction Considerations

When designing action groups, consider the differences between synchronous and asynchronous calls and be mindful of handling multiple returns and interruptions.

## Further Reading

By using action groups wisely, the project's logical structure can be significantly simplified, and code reusability and maintainability can be enhanced. Developers should fully exploit the synchronous and asynchronous characteristics of action groups to suit different application scenarios."
# Custom Function

#### Overview

In VisualLogic, custom functions are an important way to define and encapsulate application logic. By using custom functions, we can perform more complex operations on variables within the application, thereby enhancing code readability and enabling logic reuse. Custom functions can be executed synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the requirements of the function's tasks.

#### Basic Usage

Custom functions in VisualLogic are similar to action groups and can be used with or without parameters. If a function needs to manipulate variables or objects within the project, it typically requires setting input parameters and return parameters. Input parameters are used to pass variables into the function, while return parameters are used to output results from the function.

When defining custom functions, one should follow JavaScript naming conventions: parameter names can only consist of letters, underscores, dollar signs, or numbers, and cannot start with a number, and are case-sensitive.

#### Synchronous Functions and Asynchronous Functions

Custom functions can be set to be called synchronously or asynchronously when executed:

- **Synchronous Functions**: Subsequent action blocks are blocked until the function completes and returns a result. This means that the current function must finish executing before the subsequent logic can continue.
- **Asynchronous Functions**: Subsequent action blocks are executed immediately after the function starts, without being blocked by the current function. This is usually used in network requests or other time-consuming tasks to avoid blocking subsequent operations.

In VisualLogic, when calling synchronous functions, the internal syntax is `return {res1: xxx, res2: xxx, ...}`, whereas for asynchronous functions, the return format is `_funcCb (true, {res1: xxx, res2: xxx, ...})`. Developers need to use the correct syntax according to the calling method.

#### Multiple Returns and Interruption

Custom functions may contain multiple return statements. For synchronous functions, the execution will immediately halt upon encountering the first return statement, and no further content will be executed. In asynchronous functions, execution does not stop at the first return statement, and all return statements that meet the conditions will be executed. This feature can be utilized to handle complex logical judgments.

#### Handling Different Return Types

In asynchronous functions, additional return parameters can be set to determine different return types. For example, introducing a `type` return parameter to decide the subsequent logical processing based on its value. This method is particularly useful in asynchronous functions with multiple return results.

#### Importing External Libraries

VisualLogic allows for the inclusion of external libraries within custom functions. For example, by using DOM's `<link>` or `<script>` tags, CSS styles or JavaScript libraries can be introduced into the application. To achieve specific styles or functionalities, such as using the weUI style library, you just need to insert the corresponding tags and set the attributes in the appropriate location within the VisualLogic project. In some cases, these tags can be dynamically added within the function to load style libraries or script libraries.

By leveraging custom functions and making reasonable use of the aforementioned features, developers can create complex and smoothly interactive applications in VisualLogic."
# Sub-event

## Sub-Event

### Overview
A sub-event is a special component that can only be added under an action group. This mechanism allows triggering sub-events during the execution of the action group and transmitting data through parameters, providing greater flexibility and scalability for the action group. The logic of the sub-event is written within the sub-event panel.

### Use Cases
Sub-events are mainly used when complex logic needs to be implemented within an action group, such as triggering different sub-processes based on different conditions. Using sub-events can achieve complex branching and sub-processes while maintaining the main logic concise.

### Core Features
1. **Flexibility**: Sub-events allow triggering and passing parameters as needed during the execution of an action group, enhancing the interactivity and dynamism of the application.
2. **Scalability**: Allows defining multiple sub-events, enabling developers to easily manage complex logic.

### Basic Usage
- **Definition and Setup**:
  1. Enter the sub-event interface of the action group, select the action group in the object tree, and add an action group callback component.
  2. Set the callback parameters for the sub-event, ensuring that the parameter names and types match the expectations in the sub-event.

- **Execution Flow**:
  1. When the action group callback is executed, the system will automatically enter the corresponding sub-event and execute the predefined logic.
  2. Within the sub-event, you can retrieve the associated parameters passed in, edit the event logic, and control the behavior of the sub-event through parameter passing.

### Advanced Usage
Implement more complex logic using action group callbacks. For example, in a rating system, besides listening to user click events, you can also obtain the user's rating through callback parameters, thus handling the rating data within the sub-event.

### Notes
- Action group callbacks can only be added under an action group and cannot be used elsewhere.
- When setting callback parameters, ensure that the parameter names and types match the expectations in the sub-event.
- Defining a sub-event requires separately entering the sub-event interface of the action group.

### Further Reading
In the process of application development, the combined use of action group callbacks and sub-events can significantly enhance the complexity and flexibility of the application. This mechanism is particularly suitable for scenarios that require dynamic adjustment and data flow transmission.

Sub-events provide powerful scalability for action groups and are one of the key tools for implementing advanced interactive logic."
# System

## Overview

### System Overview

The System component is used to call system functions within an application to perform certain global operations. Currently common functions include:

- **Debug Records**: By calling the debug record function, you can output the running variable state of the system to the browser console, helping developers debug the application.
  
- **Set URL Parameters**: Add key-value pair information to a URL address to record forwarding, resource access information, etc.
  
- **Set Hash Parameters**: Add anchor information in the URL to enable page navigation to a specified location without refreshing.

Additionally, it can also achieve functions such as copying content to the clipboard, making phone calls, etc. The System component is typically added as a Frontend subobject, and only one System component can be added in each application.

## Usage Scenarios

The System component is particularly suitable for application scenarios that require integrated system functions. For example, in scenarios where URL parameters are needed to transmit data, or in development scenarios requiring real-time debugging of complex data interactions, the System component can perform its function well.

## Core Functions

### Debug Records

By using the debug record function, you can immediately output variable states, attribute values, text content, and other information during the application's runtime to the console. This is particularly helpful for troubleshooting and performance monitoring in complex application development. Usage is as follows:

1. In the development environment, such as Chrome browser, press `F12` or use `Command + Option + J` (Mac) or `Control + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) to open the console.
2. Set the specific content of the debug record output, such as the dynamic changes of an array, to provide better support for debugging and monitoring.

### Set URL Parameters and Hash Parameters

#### Set URL Parameters

URL parameters are used to carry query information in a URL address. By adding URL parameters, data transmission without refreshing can be realized:

- URL parameter format: Starts with “?”, key-value pairs are connected with “=”, and each pair of parameters is connected with “&”.
- Implementation process: Set events on the System component and button in the Frontend, paying attention to the following data interaction logic.

#### Set Hash Parameters

Hash parameters (anchors) are used to record page location tags. Unlike URL parameters, Hash parameters do not refresh the page, allowing them to be used in functions that need to display pages located on the client.

## Basic Usage

### Steps for Using URL Parameters

1. Add a System component in the Frontend of the application.
2. Create and configure buttons, set up click events to add or get URL parameters.
3. Process related parameter changes in the script to enhance data presentation.

### Steps for Using Hash Parameters

1. Create text variables and a banner with buttons, configure Hash parameters during application initialization.
2. Set events to get Hash parameters, save them, and use them for scrolling page display.
3. Configure click events for buttons to trigger Hash value changes and page navigation.

## Events

| Event Name      | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Receive Message | Receive messages sent through the System component, and obtain "information" and "domain name". |
| Keyboard Popup  | Triggered when the keyboard pops up.                         |
| Keyboard Down   | Triggered when the keyboard is down.                         |
| Key Press       | Triggered when any key or combination keys on the keyboard are pressed. |
| URL Change      | Triggered when the URL parameters of the current domain name change. |

## Notes

- When embedded in environments such as WebView, specific permission settings and legal domain configurations may be required.
- Hash parameters are not sent to the server via requests, they only perform location on the client-side and cannot be used in scenarios requiring Backend processing.

For more ways to use the System, you can refer to related official documents or tutorials, especially on how to leverage the System functions and integrate them with other platform features during application creation to bring users a richer interactive experience."
# File Utility

## Function Overview

The File Utility is primarily used for executing actions related to resource uploads or downloads. Through the File Utility, resource management can be achieved — uploading or batch uploading of images, files, videos, audio, etc., from local sources and downloading resources.

## Basic Usage

Resource uploads are often used in various user data collection or data customization scenarios. For example, custom user avatars require users to upload images themselves.

Resource uploads are divided into single resource uploads and batch resource uploads. This explanation will use image resource uploads as an example.

### 1. Resource Upload

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Resource Upload Action

The File Interface component does not need to be added to the object tree; it can be directly selected for use in the action panel. For instance, to upload an image when a button is clicked, add a click event to the button, select the target object "File Interface," and choose the action "Upload a Picture."

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Action to Obtain Upload Results

- In version 4.1, after the File Interface upload action is executed, you need to obtain the upload result in the callback. The callback can be used to check the status of the upload operation, including "Start Upload," "Uploading," "Upload Complete," "Upload Failed," etc.
- In version 5.0, the event panel no longer has callback blocks; you only need to add a new action block after the upload action block to obtain the upload result. For instance, in the action block, select the execution object as the image, the action as setting image resource, and then choose [Uploaded Image 1.url address] in the resource address selection box of the action parameter.

### 2. Resource Retrieval

After the upload operation is completed, the resource address is temporarily stored in the cache. When displaying the uploaded image using a preset blank image, you need to set the blank image's address to the uploaded image's resource address.

#### Implementation Example

After the upload action, select the preset blank icon for the target object, choose "Set Image Address," and select the [URL Address] of [Uploaded Image] from the dropdown menu. The preset image address can be replaced with the uploaded image address during preview, achieving image replacement.

### 3. Single Resource Download

The File Interface provides a method to download files by specifying the file name and resource address.

### 4. Batch Download as Zip

Choose the File Interface's batch download file method, which allows you to specify the zip package name and resource address array, supporting the following two formats:

- One-dimensional array: Directly use the resource address, where the resource address can be a relative address (such as the url address returned by resources uploaded in VisualLogic) or an external absolute address.
- Object array: Specify the resource address and the name of each resource in the object array, where the name needs to include a suffix.

### 5. Batch Download as Zip (including subfolders)

When downloading a Zip file with subfolders, the resource array needs to include id, parentId, name, and url columns. If the url is empty, it is a folder type; if not empty, it downloads according to the resource address, and only folder types can be used as parents.

# View Utility

## Functional Overview

View Utility components can be used directly without adding them. After the user completes various operations, they can directly call various functions, such as pop-ups, prompt texts, etc.

## Basic Usage

### Pop-ups

#### Alert

An alert pop-up informs the user of certain information through a browser dialog box. This dialog box by default contains an "OK" button. The user must click this button to close the dialog box after reading the displayed information; otherwise, they cannot proceed with other interactions. Note that the style of this pop-up is preset by the browser.

#### Display Pop-up (Mini Program Style)

In addition to using the browser's native pop-ups, we also offer highly customizable pop-ups. In its callback, different responses can be made depending on whether the user clicks "OK" or "Cancel". The pop-up is always centered on the screen.

### Loading Icons and Prompt Texts

After displaying the loading icon, remember to call the hide icon function; otherwise, it cannot be hidden, and no further operations can be performed. The duration of the prompt text display can be adjusted, and operations can continue after it automatically hides.

### Setting Web Page Title and Icon

To display different titles on different pages, you can set them in the event panel. The specific operation is: enter the event panel of the page, select the initialization event, and add an action block. In the action's left selection box, select View Utility, and in the right selection box, select [Set Web Page Title]. Then, fill in the title content you want to set in the [Title] parameter of the action. Modifying the web page icon follows the same method.

## Application Feedback

### Message Box

The interactive system provides a message box that can be called when the user operations succeed or fail, serving as interaction feedback. You can set the duration of the message box, or call the close method to immediately close the message box.

### Loading Message Box

The loading message box is used for feedback during interactions, usually for operations that require waiting, informing the user that the program is still running. This message box needs to be manually closed; otherwise, it will always be displayed.

## More Usage

### Setting Scrollbar Style

Through the [Set Scrollbar Style] action in the View Utility of the event panel, you can globally customize the scrollbar style, including: scrollbar width, height, color, thumb color, slider arc, slider color, track color.

- Loading icons should be hidden promptly to avoid affecting further user operations.
- The display duration of prompt texts can be set by the user and will automatically hide after completion.

## Further Reading

Using various prompt and style customization functions provided by View Utility can significantly enhance the user interaction experience. Proper use of different forms of feedback and prompts can guide users smoothly through various operations."
# Local cache

## Overview

In modern web applications, caching is one of the key technologies for optimizing performance and enhancing user experience. Local caching systems are used to cache important data within the browser and are primarily divided into three categories: cookie management, local storage (localStorage), and session storage (sessionStorage). Each of these technologies has distinct characteristics and usage scenarios. Effectively leveraging them can significantly improve the application's response speed and stability.

### Cookie Management

Cookies are small pieces of text information stored in the browser and are typically used for session management, personal information storage, personalization settings, and user behavior tracking. Due to security reasons, it is recommended to encrypt sensitive information when storing it.

### Local Storage (localStorage)

Local storage allows persisting a large amount of data in the browser in a key-value pair format until it is explicitly deleted. The stored data persists even after the browser or page is reloaded, making it suitable for long-term storage of user preferences or website data.

### Session Storage (sessionStorage)

Similar to local storage, session storage also saves data in a key-value pair format but is limited to the current session, with data being cleared when the window is closed. It is suitable for short-term storage needs, such as temporary session data.

## Use Cases

- **Cookie**: Suitable for storing user's login information, shopping carts, user preferences, and other small amounts of data that need to be accessed on the server side.
- **localStorage**: Used to store front-end data that needs to be retained long-term and is not lost when the session or window is closed.
- **sessionStorage**: Used for storing information that is only valid during the session, such as temporary form data.

## Basic Usage

### Setting Cache

- **Cookie**: Set cookies by passing in key-value pairs, allowing multiple to be set simultaneously.
- **localStorage and sessionStorage**: Set data in the same manner by specifying key-value pairs.

### Retrieving Cache

- Data is retrieved using the Key value set during storage, assigning the obtained data to the corresponding output object.

### Deleting Cache

- Locate and clear the corresponding cache data based on the Key value.

### Other Operations

The methods for operating localStorage and sessionStorage are similar to those for cookies, implementing cache data management through setting, retrieving, and deleting.

## Actions

| Action Name            | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set Cookie             | Sets a cookie for the current domain in the browser.         |
| Set Multiple Cookies   | Sets multiple key-value pairs as cookies in the browser.     |
| Get Cookie             | Retrieves a cookie for the current domain, requiring the key. |
| Delete Cookie          | Deletes a key-value pair cookie for the current domain, requiring the key. |
| Set Session Storage    | Sets sessionStorage for the current tab.                     |
| Get Session Storage    | Retrieves sessionStorage for the current tab, requiring the key. |
| Delete Session Storage | Deletes a key-value pair in sessionStorage for the current tab. |
| Set Local Storage      | Sets localStorage for the current domain.                    |
| Get Local Storage      | Retrieves key-value pairs in localStorage for the current domain. |
| Delete Local Storage   | Deletes a key-value pair in localStorage for the current domain. |

## Further Reading

A deeper understanding of cookie and local storage use cases and security considerations can help developers better utilize browser caching technology to provide a smooth online experience for users. By understanding the unique advantages and limitations of each caching mechanism, developers can make more informed storage decisions, thereby improving application efficiency and user satisfaction."

A trigger is a timer-triggered component used to repeatedly trigger an event or animation effect at equal time intervals. When the intervals are short enough, the triggering can be considered continuous. The trigger can be set with the number of trigger times and the interval to accommodate different triggering approaches.

## Use Cases

Triggers are commonly used in the following scenarios:

1. **Scheduled and Delayed Triggering**: Triggers can be used for single delayed actions. For example, if we want an animation effect to replay 2 seconds after its completion, we can use a trigger to achieve this.
2. **Equal Interval Triggering**: For scheduled triggers at equal intervals, triggers are more convenient than timelines. For instance, if we want a scenario to turn the page every 3 seconds automatically, a trigger can be set to play every 3 seconds and trigger the page-turning operation.
3. **Continuous Triggering**: Triggers offer continuous triggering at intervals of "every frame". A frame corresponds to the smallest unit of device display refresh, varying by device, typically one-fortieth or one-sixtieth of a second. If set to trigger every frame, it appears continuous to the naked eye, enabling certain continuous animation effects.

## Core Features

### Basic Usage

1. **Equal Interval Triggering with Triggers**
   A trigger can be set to trigger at fixed intervals. For example, a countdown component needs a counter to trigger every second, decrementing by 1 each time. We also set the trigger's play count to the current counter value so that it stops decrementing when the counter reaches 0.
2. **Using Triggers for Animation Effects**
   By setting a trigger to continuous triggering, certain animation effects can be achieved. For example, setting a trigger to increment an object's rotation angle on each trigger. Due to the short interval of the trigger, it appears as a continuous animation effect to the naked eye. Besides triggering animations, triggers can also be used for high refresh rate continuous actions.

| Property Name          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Play Count             | Maximum number of times the trigger will play each time. Defaults to unlimited and can be manually adjusted. |
| Interval               | Interval between two successive trigger plays in seconds. Defaults to every frame, corresponding to the device's refresh rate, usually one-fortieth or one-sixtieth of a second, thus approximating continuous triggering. |
| Auto Play              | Whether the trigger plays automatically, controlled by a switch, defaulting to no auto-play. |
| Animation Optimization | If using the trigger for animations, optimization is enabled by default. The trigger will automatically acquire the current device's frame rate (request animation frame) to maximize the animation effect. When optimization is off, triggers strictly use the set interval (set timeout), mainly for automatically running functions in the browser's non-active tabs. Typically, animation optimization should be enabled. |
| Parameters             | Parameter-related settings.                                  |

# Frontend

## Function Overview

VisualLogic's application adopts a frontend-backend separation architecture strategy. Regardless of the application type, when creating an application, a Frontend and Backend will be added by default. The Frontend is primarily used for creating various visual parts directly accessible to users, adding UI, and implementing various UI interaction logic; the Backend is responsible for service logic and database setup and maintenance.

The Frontend, as the topmost parent object of other objects, cannot be deleted or added and is an important area for object visual editing. The Frontend will differ for different applications. For example, the Frontend of a mini-game is a canvas, whereas the Frontend functions of mini-programs and websites/H5 are basically similar and are introduced here uniformly.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Attribute Settings

#### 1. Width, Height, Background

As the topmost parent object, the Frontend's width and height are generally set to 100% by default, occupying the entire visible window. Likewise, the background image and background color are the backgrounds of the whole application. Any component added later will be within the range of the Frontend's width and height and above the Frontend's background.

#### 2. Clip Attribute

The clip attribute is possessed by many container class components to control the display mode when elements exceed the container's range. If the element to be displayed is large and requires horizontal/vertical scrollbars, the Frontend's clip attribute can be enabled.

#### 3. Page Control

Although an application is essentially a single-page application, the existence of the "page" component allows for the division of "virtual pages" within the application. Different pages can be switched back and forth through the page variable of a URL. On the Frontend, the property "page can go back" can control whether pages can be navigated back to using the browser's back function after being switched.

On the Frontend, you can also control the "page position" attribute. The default position of the page component is fixed, and if you want to adjust it to be spliced and arranged, the page position attribute can be set to floatable.

### 2. Trigger Events

As the topmost parent object, the Frontend can listen for regular click and mouse events, as well as width and height changes, URL changes, and image paste events. Among them:

- **Width Change & Height Change**: Monitors window size changes.
- **URL Change**: The Frontend can listen for changes to the current application's access URL, but only for changes in Hash parameters.
- **Paste Image**: Can monitor user image paste events and obtain image resources.

### 3. Logical Actions

The Frontend supports executing logical actions related to page transitions and window scrolling:

- **Page Transition**: Supports transitions to internal and external links in the application. Internal application transitions can be performed according to page code or order.
- **Window Scrolling**: Specify a scroll distance and speed to scroll to a specific position, enabling page positioning or full-screen switching.
- **Close All Slidable Rows**: Used in conjunction with slidable containers.

For mini-game Frontends, similar webpage transition actions are supported, and "print canvas" actions can be executed, generating an image of the current canvas interface.

## Functional Overview

The application of VisualLogic adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture strategy, where all application types by default add both front-end and back-end upon creation. The front-end is primarily responsible for the visual part of user interaction, including adding UI and implementing interaction logic; the back-end is used for service logic and database maintenance. As a crucial area for visual editing of objects, the front-end is the top-level parent object that cannot be deleted or added.

### Basic Usage

#### I. Attribute Settings

- **Width, Height, Background**  
  As the top-level parent object, the front-end's width and height are set to 100% by default. The background image and background color represent the background of the entire application.
- **Clipping Attributes**  
  Used to control the display method of child elements when they exceed the parent object's boundaries. When enabled, child elements are allowed to scroll within the front-end's range.
- **Page Control**  
  Although the overall architecture is a single-page application, it can be divided into multiple virtual pages using the "page" component and managed via URL variables. The front-end can also set the "page rollback" attribute to control the page rollback permissions.

#### II. Trigger Events

The front-end can listen for click, mouse events, width and height changes, URL changes, and image pasting events.

- **Width Change & Height Change**  
  By default, changes in the front-end's width and height correspond to window changes, which can be used for responsive layout adjustments.
- **URL Change**  
  This can only monitor changes in the access URL of the current application, usually in situations where Hash parameters are added.
- **Image Pasting**  
  The front-end can detect copy-paste image events and obtain image resources.

#### III. Logical Actions

The logical actions involved in the front-end are mostly related to page navigation and window scrolling.

- **Page Navigation**  
  Supports internal page navigation and external link access, providing various navigation methods.
- **Window Scrolling**  
  Specify the scrolling distance and speed to achieve page positioning or full-screen switching effects.
- **Close Swipeable Rows**  
  Closes all expanded swipeable rows without needing to specify a particular container.
- **Canvas Function for Mini-Games on Front-end**  
  Provides "Print Canvas" action to generate the current canvas as an image.

This document details the absolute positioning attributes, actions, and events specific to the front-end of VisualLogic applications and aims to help developers understand and utilize the features of front-end components effectively."
# Page

## Overview

A page is a paging unit that achieves page-flipping display by dividing an area into multiple overlapping pages. In the VisualLogic development environment, a page is a fundamental structural unit that, through proper layout, can optimize the presentation structure of an example, making the content more organized. Pages are suitable for scenarios where multiple content modules need to be displayed, and by distinguishing between pages, different content can be effectively managed and presented.

## Use Cases

Page components are widely used in applications that need to organize and display multiple independent content modules. They can enhance the user experience of an application, making the content display clearer. For example, in a mobile application, page components can be used to organize different functional modules, with each page representing an independent functional area.

## Basic Usage

### Adding Pages

Pages can be added under parent objects such as the front end or containers (object groups), but not under rows (columns), banners, panels, or hierarchy objects. To add a page, you need to select its parent object and then click on the page component to complete the addition. Pages are named by default in the order they are added as "Page 1, 2... X," and the display order of pages can be adjusted by dragging and dropping in the object tree. The size of a page is determined by the size of its parent container object.

### Switching Pages

Switching between different pages is done through events. Depending on the trigger conditions, effects such as swipe-to-turn, scroll-to-turn, or click-to-turn can be achieved. For example, when you need to achieve the effect of flipping to the next page when sliding left on Page 1, you can add an event to Page 1 and set the target action to "Jump to the next page."

### Page Transition Settings

In the H5 environment, the system provides a variety of page-flipping effects, allowing users to define different entrance and exit animations for each page. If not specifically defined, the page-flipping effect defaults to no animation.

## Overview

Row is a relatively positioned container in the VisualLogic framework, primarily used for creating responsive layouts and multi-device pages. The row container allows internal elements to be arranged horizontally and automatically wrap when the remaining space is insufficient to accommodate the rightmost child element. Various child objects such as images and text can be added to the row, and other rows, columns, and absolutely positioned containers can be nested within it to achieve complex layouts. The row supports settings for different widths based on the device environment to achieve adaptive layouts.

## Use Case

Rows are often used for constructing grid layouts, especially when it is necessary to adjust element sizes based on different device resolutions. Typical application scenarios include web layout adjustments. For example, on some web pages, only 2 columns are displayed in a small window, while 3 or 5 columns can be displayed as the window widens, switching the horizontal arrangement according to different resolutions. These requirements are achieved through the design of the row, thereby enhancing the visual experience of the page.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Setting Row Width and Height

- **Width**: The default width of the row is 100%, meaning it completely inherits the width of the parent object. It can be set to a fixed pixel value or a percentage relative to the width of the parent object. If the parameter is empty, it is considered "auto wrap content," and the width of the row is determined by the total width of its elements, with a possibility to set a floating range.
  
- **Height**: The default height of the row is 100 pixels. It can be set to a fixed value or a percentage relative to the height of the parent object. If the parameter is empty, it is also considered "auto wrap content," and its height is determined by the total height of the elements. The "stretch vertically" feature can be enabled, occupying the remaining height in the parent object by default.

### 2. Auto Wrapping in Rows

Add elements to the row and enable the "auto wrap" attribute. When the browser zoom causes insufficient space to accommodate the rightmost child element, the row will automatically wrap, ensuring responsive layout.

### 3. Environment Width for Rows

The environment width of the row is used to limit the width of the row in different resolution environments, precisely matching the content width, ensuring content is centered, and improving visual effects. The row provides multiple device environment width settings, such as specifying the number of columns displayed in a small screen environment and setting specific widths for each environment.

Through the above information, the row component of the VisualLogic framework not only possesses high layout flexibility and responsive settings but also enables more complex and efficient page layouts through property adjustments and event responses."
# Columns

## Overview

A Column is a relatively positioned container that allows internal elements to be arranged vertically and is commonly used to implement responsive layouts and build multi-terminal pages. Various child objects such as images and text can be added within a Column, and same-level child objects will automatically be arranged vertically. Additionally, other Rows, Columns, or absolutely positioned containers can be nested within a Column to achieve more complex nested layouts. Columns allow different width values to be set depending on the device environment, thereby achieving adaptive layouts.

## Use Cases

Column components are often used in grid layouts, with common use cases including:

1. **List Arrangements**: Columns can conveniently achieve vertical arrangement of elements and are often used in conjunction with loop-created components to create lists. For example, they can be used to create a list of products.

2. **Multi-Column Layouts**: By nesting multiple columns within other objects, multi-column layouts can be achieved. Through setting the environment width, the number of modules and the layout changes can be flexibly responsive. Sidebars are only displayed when the window size exceeds a certain value, which requires setting the environment width of the sidebar column.

## Basic Usage

1. **Height and Width Setting of Columns**:
   - By default, the width is "auto split", which means all objects with "auto split" width properties equally share the remaining width of the parent object, with adjustable floating ranges. If the floating elements reach the maximum width but still cannot fill the space, blank areas will be used to fill it. Options include setting a fixed value (pixels) or a fixed percentage (relative to parent object percentage).
   - The height of a column defaults to 100 pixels and can also be set to a fixed value or fixed percentage. If the parameter is empty, it is considered "auto wrap content", determined by the total height of internal elements, with adjustable floating ranges.

2. **Environment Width of Columns**:
   - By adjusting the environment width of columns, module layouts in different resolution environments can be adapted, such as using a dual-column layout. When the window width is less than a specific pixel value, environment width settings can determine whether to display certain content.

# Absolutely Positioned Container

## Overview

An absolute positioning container is a tool used to create an absolute positioning environment within a relatively positioned environment. It can accommodate multimedia objects such as images and videos, and layouts are based on the principles of absolute positioning. This means that the position of objects is represented by fixed (X, Y) coordinates relative to their parent object, and the size of the objects is defined by specific width and height pixel values. Additionally, users can change the position of objects by dragging them with the mouse.

## Use Cases

The absolute positioning container acts as an "island" in a relatively positioned environment, ensuring that all elements within it have fixed positions and sizes relative to their parent object. This container is particularly suitable for creating formatting units with fixed sizes and formats.

It is worth noting that using an absolute positioning container for layouts in mobile applications generally performs better than using row and column layouts.

## Core Features

1. **Define an Absolute Positioning Environment**: Create an independent absolute positioning area within a relatively positioned environment.
2. **Accommodate Multimedia Objects**: Support insertion and absolute positioning of images, videos, and other objects.
3. **Flexible Layout Control**: Easily change the position of objects through mouse dragging.

## Basic Usage

### Adding the Container

Users can add an absolute positioning container under relatively positioned parent objects such as frontends, rows, columns, and pages. To add this container, simply select the corresponding parent object and click the relevant component button. By default, an object with a height of 150 pixels will be added.

### Example Application

A simple voting application can utilize absolute positioning containers to develop candidate cards, with the object tree structure as follows:

- **Page**
  - **Candidate List** (Array variable to manage and update candidate data)
  - **Column 1** (Belongs to Page)
    - **Row 1** (Belongs to Column 1)
      - **Loop Creation 1** (Belongs to Row 1)
        - **Voting Unit** (Absolute positioning container for displaying candidate avatars, names, etc.)
          - **Text "0"** (To display potential votes count)
          - **Icon "Heart"** (Indicates votes, popularity, etc.)
          - **Candidate Name "John Doe"** (Displays candidate's name)
          - **User Icon** (Identifies the candidate)

This hierarchical structure and loop mechanism enable good organization and display of information. Settings of pages, columns, and rows facilitate content arrangement as needed, while the absolute positioning of the voting unit provides high display flexibility.

## Overview

Object groups are widely used in web pages, H5, mini-programs, and similar applications, especially in environments with absolute positioning. These groups provide a convenient way to move and manage their contained child objects as a whole. The primary role of an object group is as a rectangular container, which can easily implement layout adjustments, with no collision detection and special features such as child object creation. Each object group allows the addition of multiple child objects and setting overall scaling options, thereby providing flexible adjustment of its content and effects.

## Use Cases

Object groups are suitable for multiple scenarios, including mini-programs, PC applications, and H5 applications, particularly in environments with absolute positioning. In these environments, the functionality of object groups makes the design and content organization more efficient and controllable.

## Core Functions

Object groups allow various common events to be triggered within a rectangular range. Designers can also set background colors and background images for the object groups and adjust the display method of out-of-bounds objects using the clipping attribute. It not only helps to manage the objects within the group uniformly but also supports users to browse contents of different sizes through the scaling function.

### How to Add an Object Group

- **Step 1:** Ensure you are in an environment with absolute positioning, which could be an absolutely positioned container, an absolutely positioned banner, or an H5 foreground.
- **Step 2:** Select the parent object to which you want to add child objects.
- **Step 3:** Select "Object Group" and draw a rectangular area to complete the addition and settings of the object group.

## Q&A

**Q: Why can't I find the object group component in my mini-program/PC/H5 application?**

A: The object group component can only be applied in an environment with absolute positioning. Only when you ensure that the environment for absolute positioning is selected in the current object tree, will the object group component show up in the VisualLogic component bar."
# Banner (absolute positioning)

## Overview

The banner component is a specialized positioning tool that remains fixed in position within a scrolling page and does not scroll with the page. It is commonly used to keep buttons or text and image content fixed at a higher layer on the page, such as back-to-top buttons, customer service buttons, and image advertisements. Essentially, a banner component is a container that fixes all its contained objects in a specific position on the page. The tool is divided into absolute positioning and relative positioning, with the main difference between them being the positioning rules for internal elements: an absolutely positioned banner embeds an absolute positioning container, while a relatively positioned banner uses a relative positioning row container. Nevertheless, the positioning and other usage methods of the banner itself remain consistent.

## Usage Scenarios

The banner tool is often used to create fixed buttons or content blocks that do not scroll out of the screen with the page. By adjusting the overall layout and offset properties of the banner, it can be positioned in a specific location within the browser window, ensuring these elements remain visible, thus enhancing user experience.

## Core Features

### Overall Positioning

The overall positioning of the banner container is mainly achieved through the following properties:

- **Overall Layout**: Sets the overall position of the banner relative to the browser window. This position is fixed on the screen and does not change with the scrolling of the entire page.
- **Horizontal Offset** and **Vertical Offset**: On the basis of the overall layout, these two properties allow for fine-tuning of the banner's current position.

### Background Overlay

The banner component provides a background overlay feature, often used to create pop-ups or prompts. When the background overlay is enabled, a transparent overlay is added behind the banner, and an event can be set up to hide the entire banner when the overlay is clicked.

## Properties

| Property Name      | Description                                                  |

By configuring these properties, actions, and events, users can flexibly use the banner component to achieve various fixed and floating effects, thereby improving web interactivity and user experience."
# Banner (relative positioning)

## Overview

A banner component is a specialized positioning tool typically used to maintain a fixed position on a scrolling page, without moving with the page content. It is often used to fix buttons or graphical/text content such as "Back to Top" buttons, customer service inquiry buttons, graphical advertisements, etc., on the upper layer of the page. For example, the "Online Customer Service" button in the bottom right corner of the page usually employs a banner component.

The banner component can be categorized into absolute positioning and relative positioning types. Their only difference lies in the positioning rules of the internal elements: the absolute positioning banner integrates an absolutely positioned container, whereas the relative positioning banner incorporates a relatively positioned row container. No matter the positioning method, the overall positioning and usage of the banner component remain consistent.

## Use Cases

1. **Fixed Floating Content**: Such as "Back to Top" buttons and online customer service buttons.
2. **Graphical/Text Advertisement Display**: Ads are fixed on the page and do not disappear with scrolling.
3. **Popup Windows**: The background overlay feature can create popup window functionality.

## Core Functions

### 1. Overall Positioning

The overall positioning of the banner is mainly configured through the "Overall Layout" attribute, which determines the banner's fixed position relative to the browser window, unaffected by page scrolling. Additionally, horizontal and vertical offset properties are provided to fine-tune the current position of the banner.

### 2. Background Overlay

The banner component can enable a background overlay, adding a transparent layer behind the banner. This feature is often used to create popups or prompts. Once the background overlay is enabled, the "Click Overlay" event can be triggered, causing the entire banner to hide when the overlay is clicked by the user.

# Layer

## Overview

The layer component is created and used in an absolute positioning environment, similar to a special banner component, floating above the page content. Its default size matches its parent object, and it cannot be customized for width, height, or position. The primary purpose of the layer is to serve as a mask.

The usage and application scenarios of the layer component can refer to relatively positioned banner components, with layers primarily used to block backgrounds.

## Usage Scenarios

Layer components are often used in scenarios requiring a masking effect, such as modal window backgrounds, image overlay effects, or other situations to enhance the user interface.

## Core Functions

- **Add Layer**: In absolute positioning applications, layers can be added to the foreground or beneath the page. A foreground layer masks the entire page, while a layer below the page only masks the current page content.
- **Set Layer**: The opacity of the masking layer can be adjusted to control whether the content beneath the layer is fully covered. Other components can be added to the layer for layout or display purposes.

## Notes

- When setting opacity in the event panel, a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 is required.
- When the component is invisible and located within a relatively positioned container, it does not occupy space in the layout.

## Further Reading

Layer components are suitable for scenarios where temporary content coverage is needed on the interface, such as dimming the background when a pop-up notification appears. By controlling opacity, developers can achieve various masking effects, from complete coverage to semi-transparent displays, and so on."
# Panel

# Panel Technical Documentation

## Overview

The panel component is a content display component that comes with scrolling (or sliding) functionality, commonly used for creating long pages or pull-to-refresh lists. The panel component has the following basic features:

- If the length of child objects within the panel exceeds the panel's viewport in any direction (vertical or horizontal), we are allowed to browse the content of the child objects by scrolling or sliding in that direction.
- It can detect user behaviors such as pull-up and pull-down, and comes with animations for pull-up loading and pull-down refreshing.

## Usage Scenarios

The panel component is often used for creating long pages with smooth sliding and scrolling functionalities, providing a good interactive experience. Additionally, the panel can be used in conjunction with loop creation components to create dynamically updated and loaded push message lists.

## Basic Usage

### Creating Long Pages

Using a panel to create a long page is very simple. Just adjust the panel viewport to an appropriate size and add child objects within it. The panel allows viewing internal objects through scrolling (or finger sliding, mouse dragging) in both vertical and horizontal directions:

- By default, both directions are scrollable. If the switch is turned off, the panel will not scroll or slide in that direction.
- [Note] Only as child objects of the panel can they be viewed through scrolling.

### Interaction Optimization (Website/H5 Environment)

In addition to basic layout features, the panel also provides pull-down refreshing and pull-up loading functionalities to optimize the interaction process:

1. **Setting Properties Panel**: First, enable the pull-down refresh functionality, and set the panel as needed.
2. **Adding Refresh Events**: After enabling the pull-down refresh, each operation will trigger a same-name event, and you need to manually end the animation after data retrieval is complete.

These two steps set up a pull-down refresh interaction optimization; the process for setting up pull-up loading is the same.

# Scalable Container

## Overview

The zoom container is a specialized layout component that controls the size of the container and its internal elements by setting zoom ratios. Essentially, it adjusts the visual size by changing the `transform` property of objects. Unlike directly changing the component's size, using a zoom container for scaling avoids DOM tree reflow and repaint, thus providing superior performance.

## Use Cases

Zoom containers are typically used within absolutely positioned containers or canvases. Their excellent object size transformation performance makes them particularly suitable for scenarios where object sizes change during animations.

## Core Features

- **Superior Performance**: Avoids DOM tree reflow and repaint by adjusting the zoom ratio instead of directly changing component sizes.
- **Flexible Adjustment**: Allows independent size adjustment of the container and its child elements by modifying the zoom ratio.

## Basic Usage

When using the zoom container, particular attention should be paid to the following properties:

- **Actual Width and Height**: These are derived by multiplying the original width and height with the zoom ratio. Typically, we fix the original width and height values and then adjust either the actual size or zoom ratio to proportionally change the size of the container and its internal elements.

For example, by fixing the original width and height, changing either the actual size or the zoom ratio will automatically calculate and adjust the other value. For adding animations, simply modify the actual size or zoom ratio values in the animation keyframes to achieve the desired effect.

## Properties

Here are the property descriptions for the zoom container component:

| Property Name     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Original Width    | The baseline value for the component's width. When the width zoom ratio is 1, this is the actual width of the component. |
| Original Height   | The baseline value for the component's height. When the height zoom ratio is 1, this is the actual height of the component. |
| Actual Width      | Actual Width = Original Width * Width Zoom Ratio             |
| Actual Height     | Actual Height = Original Height * Height Zoom Ratio          |
| Width Zoom Ratio  | The zoom ratio for the width of the component and its internal child elements. |
| Height Zoom Ratio | The zoom ratio for the height of the component and its internal child elements. |
| Background Color  | The background color of the current component.               |
| Background Image  | Sets the background image, supporting jpg, jpeg, png, and gif formats. The background image will automatically fill the entire page. The default is no background image. |
| Overflow Effect   | Handles the display effect when the size of the internal child elements exceeds the component range. |
| Hide Scrollbars   | If the overflow effect is set to scroll, you can enable this setting to hide the scrollbars without affecting the scrolling operation. |
| Perspective       | Defines the distance between the 3D elements and the viewpoint in pixels, allowing for changes in the view of the 3D elements. |
| Preserve 3D       | Applies the 3D rotation effect to child objects under the parent object. |
| Dragging Mode     | In an absolutely positioned environment, determines whether the component allows user dragging and in which directions. |
| Dragging Boundary | Whether the object is only allowed to be dragged within the parent container. |

# Table Container

## Overview

The Table Container can dynamically create a table structure with multiple rows and columns during application runtime. It controls the number of rows and columns and the content of the cells through data source binding. The Table Container is often used with databases, Excel, and other components to create online forms. Form data is typically read from or imported into a database and can be submitted back to the database or exported as Excel tables.

## Use Cases

The Table Container is suitable for scenarios that require presenting dynamic data, such as enterprise information sheets and user forms. It is frequently used in conjunction with databases to display large amounts of data and supports user modifications that can be written back to the database.

## Core Features

### Basic Usage

The use of the Table Container is similar to loop creation. It supports the addition of UI elements inside it and data binding for components. In a relative positioning environment, the Table Container arranges rows and columns based on the table direction in the data source; in an absolute positioning environment, elements overlap and need to be arranged by binding X and Y coordinates.

#### Example Creation - Constellation Table

1. **Object Addition**: Add an object array, a table container, and a text component under the front directory.
2. **Edit Data Source**: Fill the constellation table content into the object array.
3. **Property Binding**: Bind the Table Container's data source to the object array and adjust other property values.

In preview mode, you can see the complete table structure, including rows, columns, and header content. By binding the text component's content to "current cell data," the cell content corresponds to the data source.

### Advanced Usage

Each UI element within the Table Container has four accompanying values:

- **Current Cell Data**: The value of the corresponding element in the object array for the current cell.
- **Current Row Number**: The index number of the current row in the object array, starting from 0.
- **Current Column Name**: The column name of the corresponding column in the object array for the current cell.
- **Current Row Data**: The value of the corresponding row in the object array for the current cell.

Users can display and modify table data. For instance, data from a database can be output to a table, and after modification, users can click "Save" to store the data back to the database.

#### Data Interaction

1. **Save Data to Object Array**: When the input box loses focus, the data is written into the corresponding cell of the object array.
2. **Update Database**: When the user clicks save, the values in the object array are updated to the database.

It is recommended to record only the modified rows when changing data to optimize performance.

## Properties

| Property Name       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Source         | The data source for the Table Container, which must be an object array. |
| Column Width        | Sets the width of each column, with maximum and minimum values. The default is auto-distribute width evenly. |
| Row Height          | Selects the type of row height. The default is auto-wrap. Fixed row height can be set optionally. |
| Width               | The width of the outermost container of the table. Horizontal scroll bars automatically appear if the width is exceeded. |
| Height              | The height of the outermost container of the table. Vertical scroll bars automatically appear if the height is exceeded. |
| Custom Columns      | Customizes header information and order, supporting array format. |
| Show Header         | Whether to display the header. If off, only data is displayed. |
| Freeze Header       | Fixes the header at the top when enabled. Some browsers on Android do not support this feature. |
| Render Optimization | Enabled by default. Triggers re-render of the Table Container only when the data source changes. |

## Actions

| Action Name          | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Merge Selected Cells | Merges the selected cells, keeping the value in the top-left cell. |
| Unmerge Cells        | Cancels the merged state of the cells. It cannot restore cleared values. |
| Cancel Selection     | Cancels the selection state of all cells.                    |
| Scroll to Position   | Moves to a specific position in the Table Container.         |
| Scroll to Element    | Moves to a specific row and column position in the Table Container. |

## Events

| Event Name          | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Column Width Change | Triggers when the column width changes. |

## Notes

- When saving data, it is recommended to record only the modified rows instead of updating the entire table data at once, to improve performance.
- The behavior of table components may vary across different browsers, so compatibility issues should be considered, especially on mobile devices.

# Tree Container

### Overview

A tree container is a tool used for dynamically creating a multi-level directory structure. During application runtime, it can show and hide child nodes, simulating the directory effect of a file system. Its primary function is to manage the structure of nodes by binding to a data source (an array of objects), which includes the quantity of nodes, hierarchical relationships, and attribute values.

In a tree structure, each node can be expanded or collapsed if child nodes exist. The final display effect of a tree directory is similar to a list created by looping, but the difference lies in the hierarchical relationship of the nodes, determining the display.

### Use Cases

Tree containers are often used to build folder directories, project structure trees, and other interfaces requiring multi-level displays. They are very suitable for scenarios where directory nodes need to be adjusted dynamically, such as displaying corporate organizational charts and product category directories.

### Core Features

1. **Dynamic Data Binding**: Dynamically generate nodes by binding to a data source, supporting node expansion and collapse.
2. **Hierarchical Relationship Management**: Automatically arrange nodes based on parent-child relationships, supporting dynamic movement and manipulation of nodes.
3. **Associated Node Values**: Contains information such as current index, current data, sibling index, current level, and expansion state, used for node properties and event handling.

### Basic Usage

The use of a tree container is very similar to looping creation; UI units need to be added inside it, and data binding must be performed. The critical operation steps are as follows:

1. **Object Addition**:

   - Add an array of objects, a tree container, and a text component to the workspace.
2. **Edit Data Source**:

   - Ensure the data source is an array of objects that must include "primary ID field" and "parent ID field" to identify node relationships.
3. **Data Source and Attribute Binding**:

   - Bind the data source of the tree container to the array of objects.
   - Set the "primary ID field" to the column containing the primary key, and set the "parent ID field" to the parent node key column.
4. **Node Operations**:

   - In the node double-click event, you can modify the node name. Achieve node name editing by hiding the current text and displaying an input box.
   - When updating the input box content to the data source, set an appropriate delay to avoid the impact of UI refresh.

### Properties

| Property        | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Source     | Set the data source used by the tree container to expand and create; it must be an array of objects containing node ID and parent node ID. |
| Indentation     | The indentation distance relative to the previous level for each expanded level. |
| Max Level       | The maximum number of levels allowed by the tree container. Nodes exceeding the max level will be displayed as an object. |
| Expand Icon     | Set the icon style for the expand function, supporting custom uploads. |
| Collapse Icon   | Set the icon style for the collapse function, supporting custom uploads. |
| Allow Node Drag | Allow users to drag nodes to adjust their positions.         |

### Actions

| Action            | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

# Panoramic Container

## Overview

Panoramic containers are a technical tool that allows users to switch perspectives and browse within a panoramic scene. They are based on panoramic images captured by panoramic cameras and leverage computer graphics and image technology to analyze these images, constructing a controllable panoramic space for users. Users can choose the viewing direction, whether left or right, up or down, near or far, achieving an immersive experience. Compared to traditional 3D modeling, panoramic containers are simpler, have smaller data sizes, lower system consumption, and provide a more realistic visual effect.

The panoramic images used in panoramic containers are specifically spherical panoramic images, typically having a 2:1 aspect ratio, such as an 8000x4000 jpg image. This ratio image covers a 360°x180° spatial range.

## Basic Usage

Panoramic containers need to be used in conjunction with "panoramic scenes" or "panoramic videos" to be effective. For example, with a panoramic scene, users can add a "panoramic scene" component under the "panoramic container" and upload panoramic material resources. The requirements for uploading images include:

- Image size must be less than 100MB.
- Image aspect ratio must be 2:1 and width less than 15000px.
- Image format must be jpg.

If the image size exceeds 100MB or the width exceeds 15000px limits, users can contact customer support for special upload services, each service costing 100 yuan.

## Core Functions

The core functions of the panoramic container include enabling special effects through properties, such as:

- "Little Planet Effect": Expands the view during panorama container rotation.
- "Gyroscope Control": Allows users to control the view's horizontal and vertical directions via the gyroscope on mobile devices.
- "Auto Rotate" function: The scene will automatically rotate after N seconds of user inactivity.

# Image

## Overview

The Image component is used to insert images into the current page. It has the following basic features:
- Supports jpg, jpeg, png, and gif image formats, with native GIF animation support for simple animations.
- Adjustable size, position, and appearance properties.
- Image assets can be uploaded locally or retrieved from the internet via URL or Base64. By redefining the "resource address" property, image assets can be replaced without changing the current properties of the image object.

## Use Cases

As one of the most widely used media assets, images are commonly used in the following scenarios:
- As background images.
- As animation objects.
- As interactive objects.
- As page decoration.

## Basic Usage

1. **Replacing Image Assets**
   - **Local Upload**: When adding an Image component, you can select and upload an image from your local storage to the server as the image asset. You can also upload a local image again by clicking the upload icon next to the "resource address" while in edit mode.
   - **Network Images**: Enter the URL of the network image in the "resource address" property.

2. **Event Configuration**: During the runtime of the case, dynamically replace image assets using events, such as reconfiguring the image resource address with the "set image address" event.

## Properties

| Property Name       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resource Address    | The unique storage address of the image asset on the server. This address is generated automatically each time an image is uploaded. |
| Width               | The width of the current component, accepting exact pixel values in absolute positioning; percentage values can be used in relative positioning. |
| Height              | The height of the current component, also accepting pixel values or percentage values like the width. |
| Background Color    | The background color of the current component.               |
| Crop and Scale Mode | The stretch or scale mode applied to the image, offering multiple options to suit different needs. |
| Image Lazy Load     | Load images when they enter the viewport to reduce server load. |
| Blurry Load         | Load a low-resolution image first when the network is slow, then replace it with the original image once loaded. |
| Long Press Save     | In WeChat, users can long-press the image to save it.        |

## Actions

| Action Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set Image Resource  | Resets the image resource address, replacing the image asset without changing the object properties. |
| Convert to Base64   | Converts the image to Base64 encoding format.                |
| Get Original Width  | Retrieves the original width of the image asset. \           |
| Get Original Height | Retrieves the original height of the image asset. \          |

## Events

| Event Name         | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mouse Enter        | Triggered when the mouse pointer enters the image area. |
| Mouse Leave        | Triggered when the mouse pointer leaves the image area. |
| Image Load Failure | Triggered when the image resource fails to load.        |
| Image Load Success | Triggered after the image loads successfully.           |

## Extraction Considerations

- In WeChat browser, the long-press save function is only valid within the WeChat browser.
- Ensure the new resource address is in the correct format when setting image resources; otherwise, it will result in a loading failure.

## Additional Reading

- For network images, the domain name of the image server is `https://file3.ih5.cn/v35/files/`, and you can access it directly by appending the image file name to the domain name.
- When using crop and scale modes, choose a mode that fits the current design requirements to ensure the best display effect for images."
# Image sequence

### Overview

**Image Sequence Component** is used to manage and display a set of ordered image assets. This component plays the images sequentially, displaying only one image at a time. After a predetermined time interval, the current image is removed, and the next or previous image is displayed. When images are consecutive, through the persistence of vision effect, it creates an animation or video-like effect. The Image Sequence Component has the following features:

- Supports using Gif or Zip format image packs, which the system will automatically decompose into individual images;
- Supports redefining the image order and setting the playback duration for each image;
- Each image object component can add multiple image sequences, but only one sequence can be played at any time and the sequence to be played can be specified.

### Use Cases

The Image Sequence Component is suitable for the following scenarios:
- **Image Group Display**: Automatically play a group of images to achieve multi-image display.
- **Simulating Video and Animation Effects**: In situations where video quality is not highly demanding, image sequences can be used to replace videos, achieving a smoother playback effect and providing richer interactive methods.

### Basic Usage

1. **Adding Image Sequence**
   Images can be replaced through the "Image List" property, which will only change the image assets while keeping the size and position properties unchanged. Gif formatted images can be directly added, and the display time for each frame is controlled based on the total duration set in the property panel.

2. **Using Swipe to Switch Image Sequences**
   For example, set the swipe direction to up and disable the pinch-to-zoom feature. This can create an effect of opening by swiping up and can be combined with other animation effects for a richer interactive experience.

3. **Responding to Events When Playing to a Specific Frame**
   The images in each sequence are arranged in order from first to last, and you can listen to the "Play to a Frame" event. This event contains a parameter, which is the current frame number. Based on this parameter, different operations can be executed when playing to different frames.

### Properties

# Text

### Overview

The text component is used to insert text objects to record and display a segment of text. It has the following basic features:

- Allows defining the appearance of the text and basic typography.
- The text content can be set to an initial value or dynamically defined. It can fetch attribute data from system components, service return data, user behavior data (click position, scroll speed, etc.) through the formula editor and perform data operations via formulas.
- Suitable for non-Chinese texts or Chinese texts without font. If users need to use Chinese fonts with specific formatting, it is recommended to import external image assets.
- Suitable for plain text data. For formatted text or mixed text and image content, it is recommended to use a rich text editor.

### Usage Scenarios

Text objects are often used to display a segment of text within a case. Its content can come from preset content, system component attributes, calculation results (such as user input values), etc. It is commonly used in various scenarios of dynamic data display and recording, such as:

1. **Displaying User-Defined Text**
   Users can input text through an input box and display it after saving.
2. **Presenting Dynamic Data**
   Text is often used to display some dynamic data within a case. When the data changes, the text will also change in real-time accordingly.

### Basic Usage

1. **Text Typography**
   By defining the padding of the text, you can adjust the position of the text within the text box. Adjusting the vertical and horizontal distribution methods of the text can modify its distribution within the text box.
2. **Text Content Setting**

   - **Initial Value Setting of Text Content**: In edit mode, you can enter the initial content of the text through the "Content" field in the attribute box.
   - **Dynamic Setting of Text Content**: Dynamically define text content via assignment, data binding, etc. For example, you can set the text content to the content of an input box and obtain the input box content through an "assignment" action.
3. **Text Content Search**
   You can query whether the current text contains a certain character or string and output its position if included. If the string does not include the search content, the result "-1" is returned.
4. **Character Addition and Deletion**
   Perform character addition or deletion by setting the direction, position, character (or number of characters).
5. **Extract Characters**
   Extract a substring from the target text by specifying the start and end positions.
6. **Split String**
   Split the string into several subsequences based on a separator, and the obtained subsequences can be stored in a one-dimensional array temporarily.
7. **Generate Random String**
   Use this function to automatically generate a random string by the system, and you can set its length and type.

### Advanced Usage (Options)

- **Search and Highlight Text**
  You can search for specific characters and highlight the text that meets the criteria.
- **Cancel Highlight Text**
  You can cancel the highlighting of the text.

## Overview

Since it's not possible to directly specify Chinese fonts in a browser, we provide a Chinese font component. This component can convert input text into images in real-time on the backend. Therefore, Chinese fonts are essentially images rather than text. The Chinese font component supports dynamic assignment during the application's runtime. However, since it is not text in essence, the content is not rendered in real-time through front-end data, but is generated as images on the backend and returned. As a result, its value cannot be data-bound and can only be set via assignment actions.

## Use Cases

The Chinese font component is suitable for scenarios where dynamic display of Chinese text with accurate font style is required. Since these fonts are processed into images on the backend, it ensures consistent display effects across different devices and browsers.

## Basic Usage

### Uploading and Using Fonts

After uploading a custom font file in the “Text Font” option in the properties panel, you will see the newly uploaded font option in the font field. Select this font to use it.

### Assignment

#### Initial Value Setting

In the editing state, you can enter the initial text content in the “Text Content” field in the properties panel.

#### Dynamic Text Content Setting

Use the “Text Content” property to dynamically define text content. For example, when you need to set the content of a text to something else, note that if the content is a numeric type, it needs to be enclosed in double quotes, such as “1234567”, otherwise the system will report an error.

#### Trigger Events

The component will trigger a “Content Changed” event when the text content changes; the “Image Address Changed” event will be triggered when both the content and the font style change.

# Audio

### Overview

The audio component is used to insert an audio asset and monitor and control its playback behavior. VisualLogic supports audio files up to 50MB. Due to browser environment limitations, the wav format may not play correctly in some environments, so it is recommended to convert all audio assets to mp3 format. Audio assets are accessed via a resource URL, allowing you to replace the audio asset without changing the playback properties of the audio object.

### Use Cases

Audio is typically used to add background music or sound effects. Sound effects can be categorized into notification sounds and effect sounds depending on the usage scenario. Sound effects can either play automatically or be controlled by events or triggers to manage playback timing.

### Basic Usage

1. **Audio Property Definition**
    - The audio properties panel allows control over the audio volume, playback speed, mute status, and whether to display playback controls. These properties can be set in the editing state or dynamically set using "Set Properties" in non-editing states.

2. **Audio Playback Control**
    - Method 1: Enable "Show Default Controls" in the audio properties, allowing users to view audio information and control audio playback and pause.
    - Method 2: Control audio playback and pause via events, or toggle playback states using play/pause.
    - Example: Create a simple audio playback control button using an icon. When the play button is clicked, the audio starts playing, the play button hides, and the pause button shows; vice versa.
    - Besides playback and pause, you can use the "Jump To" action to set the playback progress to a specific point.

3. **Replace Audio Asset**
    - Replace the audio asset by resetting the audio URL. Coupling this with the system's upload audio action allows for user-defined audio.

- Supports setting independent font styles for each character within the text box.
- Supports inserting ordered and unordered bullet points.
- Supports mixed text and image layout and inserting videos.
- Supports inserting hyperlinks.

## Use Cases

The rich text tool is suitable for scenarios that require the display of complex font styles and layouts, making it more suitable for web content layout compared to plain text.

## Basic Usage

### Rich Text Content Editing

Rich text format adopts a specific syntax, including unformatted text, control words, control symbols, and other components. Users do not need to write code; they just need to type text in the text editing area in the editing state and use the toolbar to set the format. The system will automatically convert it into code.

In the non-editing state, complex edits require modifying the code to achieve dynamic definition of content or format. For complex edits in the non-editing state, it is recommended to use it in conjunction with the "rich text editor."

# Rich Text Editor

## Overview

A rich text editor is an embedded browser-based tool used for editing rich text content and formats. The key difference between a rich text editor and rich text is that the former only allows content editing in edit mode and hides the toolbar in non-edit mode, only serving the purpose of display without user interaction. The latter, on the other hand, allows rich text editing and formatting in non-edit mode.

## Use Cases

Rich text editors are commonly used in scenarios where users need to edit rich text by themselves, such as forum posts, encyclopedia entries, email composition, blogs, and store decorations.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of a rich text editor is similar to ordinary text editing. However, this component is designed only for content editing. To display the content, it needs to be combined with the "rich text" component. For example, in an application, you can implement a simple function of a rich text editor: a user clicks a button to complete rich text editing and passes the content to the "rich text" component for display. When clicked again, the rich text editor is shown again for modifications.

# Web page

### Overview

The web component is used to embed a web page within a VisualLogic case, with the following features:

- **Direct access to external web pages:** You can access external web pages within the current case environment without redirecting to an external link, preventing accidental exits.
- **Flexible appearance definition:** You can replace the URL without changing appearance attributes through a web link. However, ensure that the web page supports this access method.
- **Built-in scrollbar function:** It allows for the complete display of the web page and can interact with other components.
- **Page control options:** You can control the access behavior of the web object by adding close and back buttons, equivalent to embedding a small browser in the case.

### Usage Scenarios

Web components are often used to introduce external web pages into the case. For example, embedding event registration pages, product promotion pages, etc.

### Basic Usage

1. **URL Setting:**

   - In edit mode: Fill in the "Link" field in its property bar, which will serve as the initial link.
   - In non-edit mode: The link can be dynamically set through "Set Properties" or data binding.
2. **Usage in Mini Program Environment:**

   - In the Mini Program environment, the web-view component requires the linked web page to be added to the public account business domain name list. If the web page contains an iframe, the iframe's domain name also needs to be configured in the list.
   - When configuring business domain names, only registered https is supported, and the domain name format must be compliant. All business domain names need to be domain-verified before use.

# Counter

## Overview

### Counter

A counter is a crucial component for numerical storage, operations, and display, and is an indispensable part of data interaction. It can store the values generated during application runtime through assignment or data variables. Additionally, the counter has the ability to perform the following operations on its own value:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: The counter can execute actions such as increment, decrement, generate random numbers, and rounding.
2. **Logical Judgement**: It can determine whether the current value meets specific conditions, such as checking if it is a positive number, an odd number, or within a target value range.
3. **Value Display**: Besides numerical operations, the counter can also be configured as a value display component, allowing the definition of decimal places and font styles.

## Use Cases

The multifunctionality of the counter enables it to be applied in the following scenarios:

- **Count Component**: Such as recording game scores, counts, etc.
- **Logical Judgement Component**: Giving different results based on conditions, such as displaying different messages based on game scores.
- **Numerical Operation Component**: For instance, utilizing the counter for decrementing values in a countdown timer.
- **Random Number Generator**: Generating a sequence of random numbers within a specified range.

## Basic Usage

### Value Setting

- In edit mode, the initial value can be set through the "Value" property window. If not set, the default value is 0.
- In non-edit mode, dynamic value assignment is done through assignment events, ensuring the assigned content is a number. Value variables can also be bound for setting.

### Value Judgement

The counter's current value can be checked by adding judgement conditions to the trigger conditions, for example:

- Checking if it is an odd/even number.
- Checking if it is a positive/negative number.
- Checking if it is within a target value range.

### Numerical Operations

Built-in increment (decrement) actions support simple numerical operations. For example, using the counter to decrement by 1 per second in a countdown component. Additionally, addition and subtraction with specified values are supported. Complex operations can be achieved through the formula editor.

### Generating Random Numbers

Through the "Generate Random Number" action, the counter can generate a random number within a given range (a≤N≤b). If no range is set, there are no constraints. Note that the maximum and minimum values appear less frequently than the middle values.

## Properties

| Property Name        | Description                                                  |

| # QR code     |                                                           |

## Overview

The QR Code component is an essential tool within the VisualLogic system for generating dynamic QR codes. It encodes information graphically, with data types including case links, user-generated data, and more. Unlike static QR codes, the QR Code component can dynamically set information, and the system automatically generates the corresponding QR code graphic. Additionally, it provides an image-saving function, allowing users to download and share the QR code.

## Use Cases

As a convenient information transmission tool, common use cases for QR codes include:

1. **Embedding Links**: QR codes can be embedded in cases, which can be scanned using WeChat to open links in the browser. This is suitable for sharing cases, opening external links, and similar applications.
2. **Embedding User Information**: QR codes can encapsulate URLs with current user information, such as a user ID. New users can scan these QR codes to access the case and receive specific points.

## Basic Usage

### QR Code Data Setting

The information carried by the QR code defaults to NULL and can be set dynamically via assignment or data binding. When the information is a URL, the voice scan feature will automatically open the link. If the current URL needs to be set as the QR code information, add a "System" component, assign the value to the QR code, and select "System · Current URL".

### Important Notes

After compiling a mini program, the QR Code component will display above other components. Similar components that get overlaid include the Map component and Web component.

# Delimiter

### Overview

The divider component is a UI element used to create visual separation within page content. It can be either a horizontal or vertical line and is typically used to segment content when there is a thematic change on the page. This component is implemented using the `<hr>` tag within the VisualLogic tool, providing an intuitive and efficient way to display dividers. Compared to using rows/columns or absolute positioning containers to simulate lines, this method significantly saves front-end rendering resources, thereby enhancing performance.

### Use Cases

Divider components are widely used in scenarios where clear visual separation is needed. Typical uses include inserting dividers at thematic change points in long documents or complex pages to improve readability and visual appeal. The divider component is not limited to these fixed use cases; it can also be used as part of a drawing, flexibly serving as a horizontal or vertical line when necessary.

### Basic Usage

To add a divider using the VisualLogic tool, simply configure its properties. Common configurations include setting the direction of the divider (horizontal or vertical), type (solid line, dashed line, dotted border, etc.), and color. These basic settings meet the vast majority of needs, helping users quickly achieve content separation.

### Properties

The following are the properties of the divider component, presented in tabular form:

# Live Window

## Overview

The live streaming window is a special video component that can receive and play back video streams from the backend live component. The live streaming window component is typically used in conjunction with the backend live component. It acts as a front-end playback tool for the live component, retrieving video information from the pull stream address and parsing the video for playback.

## Core Features

### Fetching Live Sources

When using the live streaming window, a video source must be specified. By passing in the same stream name that was used when the broadcaster pushed the stream, the corresponding pull stream address can be obtained. Depending on the application environment of the live streaming window, different addresses for the stream can be set.

### Monitoring Push Stream

The live streaming window connects to the live component via the pull stream address, and this connection persists even if the current stream is not pushing. To provide a better experience for the live audience, we can display a series of prompts when the connected stream starts or interrupts the push. By leveraging the events from the live streaming window, we can monitor whether the stream has started or interrupted the push to provide timely feedback to the viewers at the start and end of the live stream.

## Basic Usage

### Example Explanation

1. **Fetching Live Sources**

   - First, specify the video source address for the live streaming window component. By passing in the same stream name used when the broadcaster pushes the stream, the corresponding pull stream address can be obtained.
2. **Monitoring Push Stream**

   - By monitoring the push stream events of the live streaming window, the state of video streaming and interruption can be reflected in real-time.

# Transparent Button

## Overview

The Transparent Button component is a specialized button used to achieve interaction behavior. It should only be added and used in an absolute positioning context, such as within an absolutely positioned application or container. The Transparent Button does not support adding button text or icons, making its style more concise.

The Transparent Button is generally overlaid on images to act as click areas that trigger interaction events. It can be used for the following functionalities:

- **Resolve Layering Issues**: When interaction with a lower-layered component is required, you can add a Transparent Button at a higher layer to achieve interaction without changing the visual layering.
- **Optimize Interaction Experience**: For components that are small in size or inconvenient to touch, you can add a Transparent Button to enlarge the interaction area, optimizing the interaction experience.
- **Block Long-Press Save**: In platforms like WeChat, the Transparent Button does not trigger the long-press save function. To implement this feature, you can overlay a Transparent Button to block the long-press save on the component.

## Basic Usage

The main feature of the Transparent Button is its lack of styling, allowing it to be overlaid on other components without obstructing the elements below. To add events to different areas of an image, you can overlay Transparent Buttons on different regions and add events to each button respectively. For example, to add an interaction event to the "whale" area in an image, you can overlay a Transparent Button in that area, making interactions with that area translated to interactions with the "whale."

## Properties

Below are the properties of the Transparent Button component:


| Property Name    | Description                                                  |

| Background Color | The background color of the current component.               |
| Background Image | Sets a background image for the current component, supporting jpg, jpeg, png, and gif formats; by default, there is no background image. |
| Width            | The width of the current component.                          |
| Height           | The height of the current component.                         |

## Events

Below are the events of the Transparent Button:


| Event Name  | Description                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Mouse Enter | Triggered when the mouse enters the component area. |
| Mouse Leave | Triggered when the mouse leaves the component area. |

## Notes

- The Transparent Button component can only be used in an absolute positioning context.
- When using the Transparent Button overlay, ensure the interaction logic with the lower-layered component is accurate to avoid functional obstruction.

By utilizing the Transparent Button component, we can effectively expand the interaction methods of the page, resolve complex layering issues, and optimize the user experience. The Transparent Button is a powerful tool for simplifying interaction operations."

# Panorama Object Group

## Overview

The panorama object group is a functional module that groups sub-objects within the panorama container, aiming to facilitate the overall movement management and layout adjustment of objects within the same group. Multiple sub-objects can be added within the panorama object group, such as panorama object groups, panorama image sequences, panorama images, and panorama texts, all of which are managed collectively.

## Usage Scenarios

The panorama object group is suitable for scenarios where integrated management and control of multiple panorama sub-objects are required. For example, in large-scale panorama display projects, grouping panorama objects allows for easier layout adjustments and property settings, making scene management more concise and efficient.

## Core Features

- **Property Linkage**: The property settings of the panorama object group affect all sub-objects within the group. For instance, when the panorama object group is moved, all sub-objects within the group move accordingly; when the panorama object group is hidden, the sub-objects within the group are also hidden.
- **Unified Management**: Transparency, rotation, and scaling of the object group can be set, thus simultaneously altering the display effect of all sub-objects within the group.

## Basic Usage

1. **Property Settings**: By setting the properties of the panorama object group, sub-objects within the group can automatically inherit these property changes.
2. **Position Acquisition**: The center position of the panorama object group can be obtained, and the group's central position within the panorama container can be acquired during specific actions. Using these two attributes, it is possible to change the horizontal and vertical relative coordinates of objects within the group each time the panorama container is clicked.
3. **Copy and Delete**: Sub-objects can be copied or deleted under the panorama object group component, and relevant properties of the copied objects can be set.

# Panoramic Scene

## Overview

Panoramic scenes need to be added under the "Panoramic Container" as functional modules, similar to individual pages. Users can switch between different panoramic scenes via events or the navigation bar of the "Panoramic Container". This scene-switching functionality is commonly used in scenarios such as virtual tours of properties where different perspectives are needed. Panoramic scenes allow control over the view of the panoramic container, such as initial position, field of view range, zoom range, and can set viewing area restrictions.

## Core Features

### Scene Switching

Panoramic scenes support switching between multiple scenes. Users can switch between scenes through the navigation bar of the panoramic container or via events.

### Perspective Control

Panoramic scenes provide flexible control of the perspective, mainly divided into the following categories:

1. **Horizontal Perspective**
   - Initial Horizontal Perspective: Sets the initial horizontal perspective in the panoramic scene, typically used for left and right navigation, with a range of -180 to 180.
   - Minimum and Maximum Horizontal Perspective: Used to limit the horizontal perspective range, with the minimum value needing to be less than the maximum value.

2. **Vertical Perspective**
   - Initial Vertical Perspective: Sets the initial vertical perspective, typically used for up and down navigation, with a range of -90 to 90.
   - Minimum and Maximum Vertical Perspective: Used to limit the vertical perspective range, with the minimum value needing to be less than the maximum value.

3. **Zoom Perspective**
   - Default Zoom Perspective: Refers to the initial zoom perspective, with a range of 1 to 179.
   - Minimum and Maximum Zoom Values: The smaller the value, the closer the perspective is to the panorama; the larger the value, the further away the perspective is from the panorama.

4. **Perspective Limitation Type**
   - By setting a smaller value (e.g., 50) for the maximum zoom value or directly setting it to 179 or 0 to control the perspective limit.

## Basic Usage

### Scene Uploading

When uploading panoramic images, it is recommended to use images with an aspect ratio of 2:1 and a width not exceeding 15000px. The uploaded material resources are not directly pasted as image URLs but are parsed into object formats by the system. After uploading, the system will automatically process the images into tiles, which might take 1 to 5 minutes for larger images.

# Motion Effects

## Overview

Animation components can call the system's preset animation library to add animation effects to objects, and control the trigger timing, loop count, and other parameters of the animations. Animation types include emphasis animations, entrance animations, and exit animations, each offering a diverse range of effects to choose from.

## Usage Scenarios

Animations are a widely used visual element on the internet that serve both functional and aesthetic purposes. The basic application scenarios are as follows:

1. **Convey Hierarchical Information**
   Animations can present the orderly entrance and exit of elements, transition between pages, and emphasize certain elements, providing a hierarchical visual effect that aligns with cognitive logic.

2. **Visual Feedback**
   Adding animations allows users to intuitively perceive the current flow and results of certain interactions.

3. **Interaction Function Prompt**
   Animations can visually demonstrate the interactive features of a product, providing users with a clearer understanding of the core characteristics, usage, and details of a product.

4. **Enhance Affinity and Fun**
   Besides functional scenarios, adding appropriate animations to static elements can increase the affinity and engagement of the visuals.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Adding Animations

To add an animation to an object (usually objects with visual entities such as images, text, videos, etc.), first select the object, then click the animation icon to complete the addition.

Multiple animations can be added to the same object. For better management of multiple animations, it is recommended to use an animation group. Animations can be added directly under the object or within the animation group, and the result will be the same regardless of the method used.

### 2. Selecting Animation Types

Click the "Animation Type" dropdown menu in the animation properties panel to specify a type for each animation. The system offers a variety of animations to choose from as needed.

### 3. Animation Playback Control

**(1) Triggering and Timing of Animations**
Animations can be triggered using animation groups or triggers. By setting the "Start Delay," you can specify the interval between the trigger and the animation playback, with a default value of 0 seconds (no delay). A reasonable start delay can be set for orchestrating the playback effects of a group of animations.

**(2) Other Playback Properties of Animations**
The animation duration can be set to control its playback speed; the longer the duration, the slower the playback speed. Playback count specifies the number of times the animation loops during playback.

## Properties

| Property Name          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Animation Type         | Select the animation type from the default system animation library, divided into emphasis, entrance, and exit animations. Each animation type has multiple effects, and each effect may have multiple directions. |
| Animation Duration (s) | The duration of the animation in seconds.                    |
| Start Delay (s)        | The delay before the animation starts, in seconds.           |
| Playback Count         | The number of times the animation plays each time it is triggered. The default is 1, meaning it plays once and stops. |
| Loop Playback          | Controls the loop playback of the animation via a switch, which is disabled by default. |
| Hide After End         | Whether to hide the component with the current animation after the animation ends. |
| Preview Animation      | Click the button to preview the current animation effect.    |
| Trigger Timing         | The method to trigger the current animation.                 |
| Hide Before Start      | Whether to hide the component with the current animation before the animation starts. |
| Edit Animation         | Click the button to open the animation editor to edit the current animation. |

## Common Issues

Q1: Currently, animations cannot have their properties set dynamically. How can I change the animation type dynamically?

Since in VisualLogic, animations are "virtual" objects that are essentially merged into the CSS properties of their parent object, their properties cannot be set individually. To dynamically change the animation type, you can pre-add multiple animations and let different animations play in different scenarios.

Q2: Can an animation have an end event?

Neither animations nor animation groups can have events added to them since they are not real objects. However, we can handle end events using callbacks. For example, after an animation ends, the stage can turn to the next page."
# Animation Group

#### Overview

The Effect Group is used for centralized management and triggering of a group of effects, and needs to be used in conjunction with effects.

#### Usage Scenarios

With the Effect Group, you can uniformly manage and trigger a set of effects for the same element, establishing some fixed effect sequences. This effect sequence can be used by other objects through copy and paste.

#### Core Features

- **Centralized Effect Management**: The Effect Group can organize multiple effects together for unified management.
- **Flexible Trigger Mechanism**: It can be set to auto-play, click to trigger, mouse hover, manual invocation, and other triggering methods.

#### Basic Usage

1. **Adding an Effect Group**

   - To add an Effect Group to an object, select the object first, then click on "Effect Group" to add it. Multiple effects can be added to the same Effect Group.
   - **Operation Path**:
     - Select object -> Add Effect Group -> Choose effects and configure parameters

2. **Triggering the Effect Group**

   - In edit mode, you can set whether the Effect Group auto-plays, which is enabled by default.
   - In non-edit mode, the playback of the Effect Group can be triggered through the "Play" event.
   - Each effect within the Effect Group can have its trigger timing adjusted through "Start Delay".
   - **Operation Steps**:
     - Edit Effect Group properties, choose "Auto-Play" or other trigger methods
     - Configure "Trigger" in the event panel

#### Advanced Usage

1. **Re-Playing**

   - Re-play the current Effect Group from the beginning. Note that the Effect Group is a whole, each playback starts from the beginning, unlike timeline animations that resume from the paused position.
   - **Operation Steps**:
     - Choose the "Re-Play" action in the event panel and add it to the trigger conditions.

2. **Stopping Playback**

   - Stop the playback of the current Effect Group.

# Timeline

### Overview
The **Timeline** component is used to consolidate keyframe animations from multiple tracks. It is itself invisible and has no size but can control the tracks of multiple objects within it to achieve complex animation effects.

### Usage Scenarios
A timeline alone is meaningless and must have tracks added to objects within it to consolidate keyframe animations from multiple tracks. Common usage scenarios include animation editing and video effects processing, where multiple objects need synchronized and complex animation control.

### Core Features
The timeline is a special component that consolidates the keyframe tracks of multiple objects within it, allowing simultaneous control for synchronized demonstrations. Its core features include:
- Control over auto-play and loop play
- Setting the original duration of the timeline
- Adjusting the actual duration and playback speed as needed

### Basic Usage
**How to Add**
1. Add the timeline component below the canvas or a relatively positioned container.

**Basic Property Settings**
1. **Auto-Play**: Turn off the auto-play switch if you want the animation to play after an interaction; turn it on if you want it to play automatically.
2. **Loop Play**: Turn on the loop play switch if you want the animation to play continuously; otherwise, turn it off.
3. **Original Duration**: Set the original duration of the timeline according to the specific animation requirements.
4. **Actual Duration/Playback Speed**: Control the animation length by modifying the playback speed or setting the actual duration.

**Specific Usage**
1. Add assets to the timeline and add tracks to each asset that needs to move.
2. Edit each track visually within the timeline panel to set up animations; refer to the track components section for specific track operations.

For instance, after adding a rectangle and an ellipse under the timeline, tracks can be added to them. Keyframes of these tracks can then be edited in the timeline panel to achieve synchronized animation effects.

# Slide timeline

### Overview

The Sliding Timeline is a specialized timeline that not only integrates the trajectories of multiple internal objects but also controls keyframe animations of multiple objects. Compared to traditional timelines, the Sliding Timeline has the following characteristics:

- The standard timeline has no actual size, whereas the Sliding Timeline requires specifying its range size upon creation.
- Objects on a standard timeline play along a set trajectory over time, whereas objects within the Sliding Timeline need to play by sliding within its range.
- The Sliding Timeline requires the addition of internal objects and their trajectories, consolidating keyframe animations of multiple trajectories.

### Use Cases

The Sliding Timeline is suitable for scenarios where animation playback needs to be controlled via sliding, such as:

- Interactive timelines in multimedia presentations
- Data visualization requiring users to slide and view data changes at different timestamps

### Core Functions

1. **Add Sliding Timeline**
   - The Sliding Timeline component can only be added when its parent element is a canvas. During addition, specify its width, height, and position by dragging with the mouse (adjustable in the properties panel).

   Choose the sliding direction for the Sliding Timeline playback. For example, selecting "up" means that sliding up will play the animation forward.

2. **Sliding Effect**  
   Set the animation playback effect based on the animation needs. Options include "sliding inertia" and "auto-jump to control point".

3. **Inertia Friction**  
   When the sliding effect is "sliding inertia", higher inertia friction will reduce both sliding time and distance.

4. **Jump Duration**  
   Set the duration required to jump to the next time-marked pause point after the sliding ends.

#### Specific Usage Steps

1. Add objects within the Sliding Timeline.
2. Add trajectories to objects that need to move.
3. Edit the trajectories of objects in the timeline panel and set their animations.

### Advanced Usage

The Sliding Timeline not only suits simple animation playback but also allows complex animation control. By editing trajectories and keyframes of objects, you can achieve synchronized animation playback among multiple objects and complex animation effects.

# Timestamp

#### Overview

The Time Marker Component is primarily used for adding and managing time markers within a timeline or a sliding timeline. By configuring specific parameters and events, this component can trigger events at any playback progress or pause animations at set time points.

#### Use Cases

The Time Marker Component is commonly used in the following scenarios:

- Triggering specific events at particular time points, facilitating management of playback up to those points.
- Serving as pause points in segmented animation playback.

#### Core Features

1. **Adding Time Markers**:

   - Time markers can only be added within a timeline or sliding timeline.
   - Once added, the set time markers will be displayed on the timeline panel, where they can be freely adjusted by dragging or selecting and modifying the corresponding time values.
2. **Basic Property Settings of Time Markers**:

   - **Marker Time**: Adjust the corresponding time point of the time marker by directly modifying the value.
   - **Trigger Direction**: The default trigger direction is bidirectional, meaning the event is triggered whether playback is forward or backward to the time point. It can be set to trigger only forward or only backward.
   - **Pause Point**: By default, the pause point is enabled. When playback reaches the marker's time, the animation will pause. It can be disabled so it does not affect animation playback.

#### Basic Usage

Here are examples of the basic usage of the Time Marker Component:

1. **How to Add a Time Marker**:

   - Time markers can only be added within a timeline or sliding timeline.
   - After adding, time markers can be viewed and adjusted in the timeline panel.
2. **Setting Marker Time Properties**:

   - Marker time properties can be directly modified to adjust the time point.
3. **Setting Trigger Direction**:

   - The default trigger direction is bidirectional; triggering occurs whether playback reaches the point forward or backward.
   - It can be set to trigger only in one direction: either forward or backward.
4. **Setting Pause Points**:

   - By default, the pause point is enabled, pausing playback at the marked time.
   - When needed, pause points can be disabled so they do not affect animation playback.
5. **Specific Use Cases**:

   1. **Animation Breakpoints / Time Trigger Points**:

      - In a standard timeline, enabling the pause point for a time marker will pause the animation.
      - Regardless of whether the pause point is enabled, events can be added to trigger actions when playback reaches the time marker.
   2. **Animation Jump Points**:

      - In a sliding timeline, enabling a pause point for a time marker and setting the sliding effect to automatically jump to control points allows animation to play to the nearest time marker within a fixed duration.
      - The jump duration can be adjusted, and it will automatically adapt to the set jump duration, regardless of the actual length between time markers.

#### Properties

# Path

## Overview

Trajectories are components used to set keyframe animations and tween animations for objects. By adding several keyframes to an object over the time axis and defining the object's position and state at each keyframe, the system automatically interpolates the attributes between two keyframes to achieve the animation effect. It can define not only the path of an object's position change but also various attribute changes such as size, opacity, and rotation, enabling a diverse range of animations.

Since the trajectory comes with its own timeline, it can be added to an object individually or used in conjunction with a timeline or sliding timeline to control multiple object animations simultaneously.

## Use Cases

The trajectory is a standardized animation component that can create gradient animations, free path animations, flash effects, and more. It is an essential operational element for creating timeline animations and sliding timeline animations.

## Basic Usage

### How to Add

The trajectory component can only be added to objects within the canvas.

### Basic Property Settings

1. **Auto Play**

   If the trajectory animation needs to be played after some interaction, turn off the auto play switch; otherwise, turn it on.
2. **Loop Play**

   If the trajectory animation should play continuously in a loop, turn on the loop play switch; otherwise, turn it off.
3. **Original Duration**

   The original duration can be set automatically based on the animation needs to control the length of the trajectory.
4. **Actual Duration/Playback Speed**

   To control the overall speed-up/slow-down of the edited trajectory animation, you can adjust the playback speed or directly set the actual duration to control the length of the actual animation.
5. **Start Delay/Initial Hidden/Generate Animation Effect**

   These properties are mainly for the animation effects generated by the trajectory. Please refer to specific usages for detailed operations.
6. **Start Visible/End Visible**

   Within the set original duration, further set the visible and hidden periods of the object corresponding to the trajectory. Please refer to specific usages for detailed operations.

### Specific Usage

#### Keyframe Animation

1. **Drag the Indicator**

   The indicator is located within the timeline panel's time scale. By clicking any position on the time scale, the indicator will automatically move to the clicked position; or drag the indicator directly to the time point where you need to add a keyframe. You can also enter the time value and press the Enter key to adjust the precise time point.
2. **Add/Delete Keyframes**

   When the indicator is selected (the selected state is yellow, unselected is gray), the diamond button above the time scale will turn into a plus sign. Click it to add a keyframe. To delete a keyframe, select it and click the minus button.
3. **Modify/Copy/Paste Keyframes**

   After selecting a keyframe, you can modify the properties of that object. Pressing the Enter key will complete parameter recording. Modifying object properties without selecting any keyframe is invalid. You can quickly set multiple keyframe properties through copy and paste.

#### Flash Animation

For a group of objects in the timeline/sliding timeline component, sequentially modify their trajectory properties such as start visible/end visible. Then set the playback speed of the timeline.

#### Generate Animation Effect

When multiple objects require the same type of keyframe animation, you can first add a trajectory to a single object. After setting the keyframe, click the generate animation effect button. Then select other objects and click the animation effect button to apply the same animation.

# Motion

## Overview

Motion is a standardized animation component used to add linear motion effects to objects on the canvas. By specifying the direction of movement, initial velocity, and acceleration, the parent object can execute linear motion, achieving acceleration or deceleration under the influence of acceleration. By controlling the direction of speed and acceleration, objects can also follow a parabolic trajectory.

## Usage Scenarios

The Motion component is suitable for scenarios where dynamic movement of objects is required within the canvas, such as character movement in game development, or linear/parabolic motion of objects in animated scenes.

## Core Features

### Property Settings

1. **Speed & Acceleration**

   - Movement speed and acceleration are the primary properties of motion. When setting, it is required to specify not only the numerical values but also their directions. According to physical laws, when acceleration and speed are in the same direction, the object will perform linear acceleration, deceleration, or uniform motion; if there is an angular difference between speed and acceleration, the motion trajectory will be parabolic.
2. **Start Delay**

   - Sets the delay time for the start of the motion. For example, if set to 1 second, the motion will wait for 1 second after being triggered before starting.
3. **Autoplay**

   - Determines whether the motion plays automatically after being added.
4. **Auto-remove**

   - Decides whether to automatically remove the object once it moves out of the canvas bounds.

### Events and Actions

The trigger events and logical actions of the Motion component mainly revolve around the start and stop of the motion. The primary events are:

1. **Start**

   - Triggered when the motion starts playing.
2. **End**

   - Triggered when the motion stops or when the object moves out of the canvas bounds.

## Basic Usage

### Adding Motion to an Object

Motion can only be added to components under the canvas. When adding, select the object that needs to execute the motion effect in the object tree, then choose and add the Motion component from the component bar on the left.

### Operation Steps

1. **Select the Object to Add Motion**

   - Select the target object from the object tree.
2. **Add Motion Component**

   - Find the "Motion" component in the left component bar and add it to the selected object.
3. **Set Properties**

   - Set parameters such as speed, direction, and acceleration as needed.
4. **Set Start Delay and Autoplay**

   - Set the start delay and whether to autoplay.
5. **Complete Settings and View Effects**

   - Confirm all settings and run to view the motion effect.

# Dropdown Menu

## Overview

Dropdown menu component is a UI component used for quickly creating dropdown selection menus. It can be used standalone or combined with other related dropdown components. The dropdown menu component provides various configurations for the input box style and the options list.

## Basic Usage

### Adding the Dropdown Menu Component

The dropdown menu component can be added under various parent objects, including frontend, pages, containers, rows, and columns. In these parent objects, select one and use the "Interaction & Forms - Dropdown Menu" from the extension component menu to complete the addition. In an absolute positioning environment, you need to manually draw a rectangular area for adding. This component is applicable in both relative and absolute positioning environments.

### Adjusting the Dropdown Menu Appearance

The dropdown menu consists of an always-visible selection bar and a dropdown options box that appears upon clicking. The background color, text color, and font size of these two parts can be customized. By configuring features like "Placeholder", "Clearable Single Choice", and "Searchable", the interactivity of the dropdown menu can be enhanced.

The dropdown menu can change its size through the "Width" and "Height" properties, and the text properties can be used to adjust the font style to enhance visual effects.

### Setting the Dropdown Menu Options List

The dropdown menu component provides multiple ways to set the options list. The most basic method is to directly fill in the option names in the "Options List" property using a one-dimensional array format. Multiple options are separated by commas. Once set, the dropdown menu will display the specified options.

## Core Features

### Retrieving the Selected Value of the Dropdown Menu

There are two methods to retrieve the selected value of the dropdown menu:

- **Retrieve through the "Selected Option" event**: Captures the value selected by the user in real-time.
- **Retrieve through the "Current Selected Value" property**: Used to uniformly read the selected value in other component events, such as obtaining it during form submission.

Note: In advanced scenarios, the display value and the selected value may need to be separated. In such cases, different advanced option setting modes can be used.

### Manually Setting/Clearing Selected Options

- **Manually Set Selected Value**: Values can be directly entered in the "Current Selected Value" property, bound to variables, or set through events to achieve manual setting.
- **Clear Selected Options**: The "Clear Selected Options" action can be used to reset the menu to a state where no option is selected.

# Multiple Selection Dropdown Menu

## Overview

The multi-select dropdown menu component is a fundamental component that allows users to select multiple options from a list. Unlike traditional single-select dropdowns, a multi-select dropdown lets users select multiple options simultaneously and displays the selected values as tags within the selection box. These tags can be individually removed by clicking the delete icon. This component is commonly used for collecting complex information, such as in surveys and user preference statistics.

## Use Cases

The multi-select dropdown menu has a wide range of applications and can be used wherever multiple user selections are needed. For example, asking users for their opinions on different issues in online forms, or collecting users' preferences on products on e-commerce platforms. This not only enhances the flexibility of user interaction but also provides multi-dimensional data support for data analysis and user research.

## Core Features

- **Selection Display and Deletion:** Each selected option is displayed as a tag in the selection box. Users can remove unnecessary tags by clicking the delete icon.
- **Event Triggers:** Events are triggered when options are selected or removed, providing effective interactive feedback to users.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of the multi-select dropdown menu is similar to the single-select menu but offers multi-selection and tag deletion features:

- **Add Multi-select Dropdown Menu:** Users can add this component under most parent objects like pages, containers, and rows/columns. For absolutely positioned containers, the rectangular area needs to be manually drawn to complete the addition.
- **Adjust Option Display:** After selecting multiple options, these options will be displayed as tags. Each tag comes with a delete function, and clicking it will remove the selected tag.
- **Selection and Selected Value Management:** The selected values are in string format, with tags displayed in the order of original options. However, the order in the selected string may vary; therefore, it needs to be sorted before string comparison.

## Advanced Usage

The multi-select dropdown menu offers more core customization features:

- **Custom Option List:** Allows users to define option lists via component properties and control the custom display of dropdown menu selection groups and option components through switch functions.
- **Enhanced Search Capability:** Use the "searchable" attribute to enable search functionality, allowing users to quickly find matching options by entering keywords.

The Search Component is widely used in scenarios where specific content needs to be retrieved. Here are the most common applications:
- **Display Search History**: By saving and calling search records from local cookies, users can quickly retrieve historical search suggestions.
- **Save Input Time**: Users can achieve quick searches by selecting suggested items without inputting complete keywords.
- **Prompt Search Scope**: Predefined data ranges can be displayed in advance to help users correct possible errors during input. For example, when querying employee personnel files, if the name is inputted incorrectly and no corresponding suggestion is available, it can be corrected promptly.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Search Style Settings
The Search Component allows customization of placeholder text, search icons, and their display positions, and it supports adjusting the font size of the placeholder text. The search icon can also be used as a search button, with the search operation executed upon clicking the icon.

### 2. Setting the Search Scope
The search suggestion scope can be defined through preset strings or bound variables. The preset string method is simple and convenient, suitable for smaller data volumes, while the bound variable method is more suitable for complex data structures that need dynamic updating.

> **Note**: Setting too large a search scope in the case of large data volumes may lead to performance delays.

### 3. Using the Search Value
The search value of the Search Component refers to the text currently inputted by the user. This value can be used not only for backend search requests but also for defining search trigger conditions through frontend logic, thereby avoiding unnecessary search requests.

### 4. Common Trigger Events
Through the Search Component, users can initiate searches and obtain search keywords. The following trigger events are particularly important:
- **Clicking the Search Icon**: Retrieve the current search value and execute the search action.
- **Clicking a Suggestion Item**: Acquire the content of the selected suggestion item as the search keyword.

# Rating

## Overview

The rating module is a component used to add user rating functionality or display ratings, adopting the most common five-star icon style. Users express different rating values by clicking on the number of illuminated stars. Common functions of the rating component include:

- Allowing the redefinition of appearance, including icon size, and colors for selected and unselected stars.
- Allowing users to rate or modify existing ratings, and can also be used as a "read-only" mode for display only.
- Allowing the definition of whether to display numerical scores and whether half-star ratings are allowed or not.

The rating component can be added under various parent objects in website systems and H5 environments, including front-end, pages, containers, rows, and columns. When adding, you need to select its parent object and add it through "Extended Components - Interaction & Forms - Rating". In an absolute positioning container, you need to manually draw a rectangular area to add it. This component supports both relative and absolute positioning environments.

## Usage Scenarios

The rating component is a common interactive component widely used in e-commerce and consumer platforms to solicit customer ratings for merchants and products, as well as to rate certain entertainment content.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Appearance of Ratings

The rating component's rating animation and star icons are embedded within the system and do not require adjustments. Users can customize the number of stars, icon size, and the colors of stars before and after selection. The "Allow Half-Rating" function can be enabled to support precise operation with 0.5 points.

### 2. Reading and Judging Ratings

Enabling the "Show Current Score" feature allows the current score value to be displayed directly after rating. For instances where different content needs to be displayed based on score range, you can use the "Set Score" event of the rating component. You can add different conditions based on the "Current Score" to trigger corresponding event logic.

### 3. Restricting Rating Modifications

In some scenarios, if only one-time rating is allowed and modifications are not permitted, you can set the component properties to read-only after the rating action is completed. Additionally, you can change the color of un-rated options to distinguish un-rated options. In read-only mode, unselected star icons will display as solid stars.

# Tab Container

### Overview

**Function Overview**

The combination of a tab container and tabs allows for the switching display of different content areas. Under different tabs, different groups of content can be defined and displayed separately. Each tab container acts as a parent object that can accommodate multiple tabs, and all tabs share a single target display area. Clicking on different tabs will switch the display. Users can monitor whether a tab is selected or deselected through events.

Tabs can integrate similar content and distinguish different segments, helping to achieve a clearer and more organized web layout by effectively utilizing space. This is commonly found in scenarios such as news pages and e-commerce product displays that require categorized displays.

### Basic Usage

1. **Add Tab Container**

   To achieve page layout and content partitioning, the first step is to add a tab container. There are two types of tab containers: relative positioning and absolute positioning:

   - Relative positioning tab containers are suitable for relative positioning environments such as front-end, row, and column. First, select a relative positioning parent object, then add it through the toolbar "Extend Component > Page Navigation > Tab Container".
   - Absolute positioning tab containers are suitable for absolute positioning containers. First, select an absolute positioning parent object, then add it by drawing a rectangle in the target area through the toolbar "Extend Component > Page Navigation > Tab Container".

   **Note**: When creating a tab container, it comes with two tab components by default as initial subcomponents.
  
2. **Tab Container Property Settings**

   Tab containers provide various properties to meet the needs of different scenarios. Here are some explanations of important properties:

   - **Tab Style**: Provides various styles for tab labels to display different selected states, allowing users to choose as needed.
   - **Tab Position**: Can be set to Top, Bottom, Left, or Right, suitable for different display needs. When set to Top or Bottom, the tab distribution can be adjusted to be equally spaced, aligned left, or aligned right; if the tab position is set to Left or Right, the system provides a minimum width adjustment option.
   - **Default Selected Tab Index**: Can set the initial selected tab index, with a default value of 1. This setting is related to the actual position of the tab in the object tree.

# Navigation Page

## Overview

The navigation page component is used to add pages within a navigation page container and must be used in conjunction with the navigation page container. Its properties and usage are similar to the tabs in a tab container and can be referred to for usage guidance.

## Basic Usage

### Adding a Navigation Page

1. **Add a Navigation Page**: Select the navigation page container, click on the toolbar's extension components > Page Navigation > Navigation Page to add a navigation page. You can repeat this operation multiple times to add multiple navigation pages within the same navigation page container. The system will automatically name these as "Navigation Page 1", "Navigation Page 2", etc.
2. **Arrange Navigation Pages**: Navigation pages are arranged in the order they appear in the object tree. The lower they are positioned in the object tree, the more to the left their tabs will appear in the tab container.

### Setting Navigation Page Properties

Each navigation page acts as an independent page where layout components and UI components can be added. Besides setting general properties (such as background color, background image, etc.), you can also modify the tab title and icon to enhance user interaction experience. The width, height, and vertical margins of icons can be finely adjusted to meet different needs.

### Selecting and Switching Navigation Pages

Similar to the operation logic of tabs, navigation pages can set select tab and leave tab events. When the user clicks on a navigation page tab, the actions within the select tab event are executed; when the user switches to another tab, the actions within the leave tab event are executed.

### Overview

The navigation menu container is used to add navigation menus to websites or applications, typically in conjunction with the "menu option" component. Each navigation menu container is an independent menu sequence that can accommodate multiple menu options. Both the navigation menu container and each option can be styled individually, with the menu expanding through clicks or hover actions. Users can define specific actions for each menu option, such as page transitions upon click. Such navigation menus are generally seen at the top or side of the main navigation bar of a website, and are often used to create dropdown menus.

### Use Cases

The navigation menu container can be used for:

- Top or side navigation bars
- Dropdown menus
- Complex interfaces requiring multi-level menus

### Core Features

1. **Independent Menu Sequence**: Each navigation menu container corresponds to an independent menu sequence.
2. **Style Settings**: The style of each menu and option can be set individually.
3. **Interaction Methods**: Menus can be expanded through clicks or hover actions.
4. **Action Definition**: Users can define actions for each menu option separately, such as page transitions.

### Basic Usage

#### Adding Navigation Menu Container

1. **Positioning Method**:
   - **Relative Positioning**: Suitable for relative positioning environments like the front-end, rows, and columns. Select the parent object with relative positioning, click the extension components on the toolbar, and then select the tab container in the page navigation to add.
   - **Absolute Positioning**: Suitable for absolute positioning environments. Select the parent object with absolute positioning, click the extension components on the toolbar, then select the tab container in the page navigation and draw a rectangular area in the target area to add.

> Note: When creating a navigation menu container, the system will automatically add two menu option components to it.

It supports website systems and mini-program applications and is suitable for relatively positioned environments.

### Usage Scenarios

The mobile city selector is designed specifically for mobile interfaces and is commonly used in scenarios where a city selection is needed in mobile applications. For example, when users need to choose their city, fill in a delivery address, or search for a destination in a travel app, this component can provide a convenient selection method.

### Core Features

The primary core features of the city selector include:

- **Location Selection**: Independently select "Province," "City," and "District" through three separate wheels.
- **Interactivity**: Each time users scroll and click to select a province, city, or district, it is considered as selecting that city.
- **Layout Integration**: Can be flexibly integrated with various parent objects such as front-end interfaces, pages, or containers.

### Basic Usage

1. **Component Appearance Settings**:
   - Users can easily modify the color of the cancel and confirm buttons to adjust the appearance of the component.
   
2. **City Selection and Assignment**:
   - When users select a province, city, and district through the wheels, the selected value is considered the final selection. This can be output to an object (e.g., text) through assignment.

   Note: If a display-triggering event is not added, the selector will default to hide when the "Cancel" or "Confirm" buttons are clicked.

# Slidable Button Group

## Overview

A slideable button group is a component designed specifically for slideable containers, allowing users to display preset action options when sliding. Users can enrich the interactive experience of the slideable container through this component. This component offers flexibility, enabling users to choose whether the button group appears on the left or right side of the container. A left slide reveals the left-side button group, and a right slide reveals the right-side button group. This design provides users with a convenient interface that does not occupy persistent view space yet displays a rich array of action options when needed.

## Use Cases

A slideable button group should be used within a slideable container, in conjunction with a slideable row, to achieve a customized user interface. It is commonly used for extending actions on list items, such as adding delete or pin-to-top actions for each list item. By sliding to reveal hidden action buttons, effective use of screen space is achieved.

## Basic Usage

The primary function of a slideable button group is to customize the layout of action buttons visible after a slide, with these buttons being hidden before the slide. By setting the position attribute within the container, users can determine whether to display the button group through a left slide or a right slide. If different button actions are desired for both left and right slides, two button groups can be added to a single slideable container, one placed on the left and the other on the right. Thus, upon completing the slide action, the button group on the corresponding side will be displayed.

## Properties

| Property Name | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Position      | Sets the position of the button group within the container, such as the left or right side. |

## Notes

- Multiple slideable button groups can be added within a slideable container, but there must be at least one slideable row present, which is a default and non-removable setting.
- A maximum of two button groups can be set, one on each side. If two button groups are placed on the same side, the latter added button group will overwrite the previous one.

# Bar-Line Chart

### Overview

The column-line chart is a composite chart that combines a column chart and a line chart into one. It integrates the capability of a column chart to intuitively display specific data sizes with the ability of a line chart to reflect trends. The column-line chart supports setting independent Y-axes for each series. Users can switch between "column" or "line" display by adjusting the "Series Type" attribute. This chart offers a variety of functions and customization options, making it highly versatile.

The column-line chart uses vertical or horizontal columns (data points in the line) to display value comparisons between categories. In the chart, one axis represents the categories to be compared, while the other axis represents the corresponding values.

### Core Features

1. **Multiple Series Display**: Multiple data series can be displayed simultaneously in the same chart, distinguished by different colors for each series.
2. **Series Customization**: Users can customize each series' display type (column or line), series color, label display, and other settings.
3. **Independent Y-Axis**: For series with significant data differences, an independent Y-axis can be configured to accurately present the data variance.

### Basic Usage

1. **Data Table Structure**:
    - The data table structure contains three fields: series, category, and data. Series group the data and distinguish them with different colors; category represents the specific classification under each series.

2. **Adding Multiple Series**:
    - Users can add new series to the column-line chart as either column or line displays. Series settings like series color, series type, and label display can be configured for each series.

3. **Editing Y-Axis Data**:
    - For new data series that do not share the Y-axis with existing series, users can add new Y-axes. Configurable settings include the axis name, label font size, Y-axis display position (left/right), and percentage display for data.

# Gantt chart

### Overview

A Gantt chart is a tool that represents the sequence and duration of specific projects through an activity list and a time scale. In a Gantt chart, the horizontal axis represents time, the vertical axis represents projects, and bar charts represent the planned and actual completions over the period. This graphical representation can intuitively demonstrate the scheduled timeline and its comparison to the actual progress. Unlike a funnel chart, a Gantt chart is drawn from bottom to top according to the order in the data table.

### Use Cases

Gantt charts are widely used in project management; they provide a visual representation of task progress through bar charts. Project managers typically use Gantt charts to evaluate resource utilization and project progress to ensure projects are completed as planned.

### Core Functions

The core functions of a Gantt chart include:
- Displaying the planned and actual progress of project tasks.
- Editable data, convenient for project adjustments.
- Support for custom chart themes and color schemes.

### Basic Usage

The data table structure for a Gantt chart includes the following three fields: category, start time, and end time. The category represents the name of a single project. When editing or assigning data for the Gantt chart, this structure must be followed.

#### Example Explanation

To implement a Gantt chart in the VisualLogic tool, a data table needs to be prepared with the following structure:

- **Category**: The name of the task or project.
- **Start Time**: The start time of the task.
- **End Time**: The end time of the task.

This data will be used to generate the Gantt chart, showing the distribution of each task on the timeline.

### Properties

# Pie Chart

## Overview

A pie chart is used to display the proportion of different categories within a total. In a pie chart, each data point is represented as a single-colored sector, with its arc length, central angle, or area size indicating the proportion of that data point relative to the total. Pie charts typically include a legend to show the mapping between the colored sectors and the data, with text labels marking each sector's category name.

Pie charts can be edited through the data pane or by using events to modify the chart data, and are drawn clockwise in the order of the data table. Multiple series of data can be set in a pie chart, and when the pie chart data includes multiple series, a ring will be drawn in the outermost series to display other series.

## Use Cases

Pie charts are commonly used to visually display the proportions of different components within a total. Common analysis scenarios include:

- Displaying expense or revenue proportions
- Displaying company market shares
- Displaying proportions of data source channels

In properties settings, pie charts can also be transformed into a rose chart (cockscomb chart, polar area chart), which is a polar-coordinate bar chart. Rose charts use the radius of sectors to represent data size, or both radius and angle, increasing data visualization differences. Due to the squared and higher relationship between radius and area, rose charts exaggerate data proportions, especially suitable for comparing similar values. Rose charts are also suitable for representing time concepts within a cycle, such as weeks or months.

## Basic Usage

The data table structure for pie charts is as follows:

- **Series**: Grouping of data, with each group forming a ring
- **Category**: Classification within the same series
- **Data**: Data values for each classification

When editing or assigning data to draw a pie chart, all three fields must have values for the pie chart to be correctly rendered.

## Properties

| Property Name        | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Chart Data           | The data source for the current chart, which should be filled or modified according to the provided template format. |
| Rose Chart Options   | Select whether to use a rose chart and its style from the drop-down list. Options include "Off" (default), which does not enable the rose chart option; "Radius and Angle" which uses both radius and angle to represent data values; "Radius Only" which uses only radius to represent data. |
| Inner Radius         | The radius of the inner hollow circle of the pie chart, default is 0%, setting this makes the pie chart a ring. |
| Outer Radius         | The radius of the pie chart, used to define the size of the pie chart. |
| Use Color Gradient   | Switches all sectors of the same series within the pie chart to the same color, but the color lightens proportionally to the data value represented by the sector. |
| Labels Centered      | Makes each sector's label hidden and the label appears in the center of the pie chart when hovering over the corresponding sector. |
| Label Position       | Can be set when "Labels Centered" is off. Options include label outside the chart (default), inside the chart, or hidden. |
| Label Display Format | Sets the display format for sector labels, optional formats include Name (default), Data, Percentage, Name:Data, and Name:Data(Percentage). |
| Start Angle          | Sets the angle at which the pie chart starts drawing, default is clockwise from the 3 o'clock direction. Setting the start angle counter-clockwise rotates the starting position. |
| Label Line Color     | Sets the label line color.                                   |

# Polar Coordinate System Cylinder Chart

### Overview

A Polar Coordinate System Bar Chart is an affine transformation of a Cartesian coordinate system bar chart to a polar coordinate system. Its significance and usage are similar to bar charts, primarily used for comparing data sizes among different categories. In a polar coordinate bar chart, the angular axis represents categories, while the radius of each category sector on the radial axis indicates the data value size.

Beyond basic usage, the polar coordinate bar chart can be reversed to swap the meanings of the two axes, transforming it into a "Rose Chart". Since a Rose Chart uses angles to represent the size of each ring, the angle becomes a determinant factor. Even if the outer ring has a smaller value than the inner ring, each outer ring will appear relatively longer than the inner rings, which can cause visual misinterpretation. Therefore, the practical use of Rose Charts is limited, mostly serving aesthetic purposes during presentations.

### Use Cases

Polar Coordinate System Bar Charts are mainly used for comparative analysis of data across different categories and are suitable for the following scenarios:

- Data categorization display
- Comparative analysis of different category data
- Artistic data visualization to enhance visual appeal

### Core Features

1. **Data Categorization**: Display data categorization and grouping within the polar coordinate system.
2. **Reverse Chart Transformation**: Convert the polar coordinate bar chart into a Rose Chart by swapping meanings of the axes.
3. **Data Beautification**: Utilize colors and graphic design to make data visualization more aesthetically pleasing to meet aesthetic needs.

### Basic Usage

#### Data Table Structure

The data table structure for a polar coordinate system bar chart is as follows:

- Series (`series`): Data grouping, which divides data into different categories.
- Category (`category`): Further subdivisions under each series.
- Value (`value`): Specific data values for each category.

These fields are mandatory to ensure complete and accurate data visualization.

#### Operation Steps

1. **Prepare Data**: Prepare the required data according to the above table structure, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.
2. **Set Parameters**: Configure the chart parameters, such as category intervals, colors, and overlapping displays.
3. **Render Chart**: Use VisualLogic tools to import the configured data and parameters, rendering the polar coordinate system bar chart.

### Advanced Usage

#### Chart Reversal

# Radar Chart

### Overview

Radar charts, also known as spider charts or web charts, are a type of two-dimensional graphic used to display multivariate data. They represent several quantitative variables starting from a common central point with each variable mapped along a separate axis. These axes typically terminate at the edge of a circle. Data points for the same group are connected with lines, forming the radar chart. This type of chart assists in displaying multidimensional data where the relative positions and angles of the axes carry no information.

### Use Cases

Radar charts have significant applications in the following scenarios:

- **Data Comparison**: Comparing multiple groups of data across several dimensions. For example, they can be used to compare several companies based on multiple metrics such as profitability, productivity, liquidity, safety, and growth.
- **Distribution Display**: Showing the distribution of a single subject across different categories, such as displaying ratings of a product across various attributes.

### Core Functions

1. **Multidimensional Data Display**: Displaying data across multiple dimensions using several axes.
2. **Series Comparison**: Defining multiple series to compare different groups of data within a single radar chart.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visually displaying differences in data across each dimension for multifaceted analysis.

### Basic Usage

#### Data Table Structure
The data table for the radar chart consists of four fields:

1. **Series**: Groups the data, where each group forms a radar chart.
2. **Category**: Classification under the same series that corresponds to the axes in the radar chart.
3. **Data**: Data points under each category, plotted on the respective axes.
4. **Maximum Value**: Specifies the value on the radar chart’s outermost line on each axis, essentially defining the unit scale.

When editing or assigning data to a radar chart, follow this structure to fill the data.

### Advanced Usage (Examples)

1. **Editing Data Series**: Set up multiple data series to generate multiple shapes within the same radar chart. Each series should define several data rows and also specify “Category”, “Data”, and “Maximum Value”. Ensure that all series within the same radar chart have the same categories and maximum values for effective comparison.

2. **Comparison Function**: Multiple series can be placed together to compare differences across each dimension. For example, comparing several companies on different financial metrics provides a clear view of each company’s strengths and weaknesses across these metrics.

# Scatter Plot

## Overview

### Scatter Plot
The scatter plot, also known as the X-Y plot, displays all data as points on a Cartesian coordinate system to show the degree of influence between variables. The position of the points is determined by the values of the variables.

By observing the distribution of data points on the scatter plot, we can infer the correlation between variables. If there is no relationship between variables, the scatter plot will show randomly distributed discrete points. If there is some correlation, most data points will be relatively dense and show a trend. The correlations can mainly be divided into: positive correlation (both variable values increase simultaneously), negative correlation (one variable value increases while the other decreases), no correlation, linear correlation, exponential correlation, etc.

For variables that have a close relationship but cannot be accurately expressed like mathematical and physical formulas, the scatter plot is a great graphical tool. However, it is important to note during analysis that the correlation between these two variables does not equate to a definite causal relationship; other influencing factors may also need to be considered.

Scatter plots in VisualLogic have the following features:
- Multiple series of data can be displayed simultaneously in the same scatter plot, and each series' color can be customized by editing the color data;
- The characteristics of a bubble chart can be attached to a scatter plot, where the size of the points in the scatter plot can reflect the size of a certain dimension of data;
- Regression lines (the most accurate line through all points) can be added to the scatter plot for inductive analysis of existing data to conduct predictive analysis.

Scatter plots are typically used for correlation analysis between variables and for predicting future data when correlation exists.

## Use Cases
Scatter plots are suitable for the following scenarios:
- Correlation analysis between data variables
- Predicting data when correlation exists

## Core Functions
- Display multiple data series with editable series colors;
- Point size can vary based on the size of a certain dimension of data;
- Add regression lines for data prediction.

## Basic Usage
The data table structure for a scatter plot is as follows:

The data table contains five fields: series, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, label, and point size. Series group the data, using different colors to distinguish; the label is an identifier for each row of data; x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and point size are specific data from three different dimensions. Generally, the x and y coordinates are the two data sets we want to analyze for correlation. For example, the x-coordinate is GDP per capita, the y-axis is life expectancy, and the point size represents the total population of a country. The data for the scatter plot must be filled according to the structure of the data table above, where the x and y coordinates cannot be omitted and are essential for drawing the scatter plot.

# Multi-column Selector

## Overview

The Multi-Column Selector is a web form component used to generate a selection menu with multiple columns of options. Users can click to select an option from multiple lists. By default, the component is displayed with a background overlay. The Multi-Column Selector essentially combines multiple single-selectors, and the selected option values are returned as a one-dimensional array composed of the selected values from each column.

### Use Cases

The Multi-Column Selector is typically used as a sliding menu that allows users to select options from multiple lists on a web page. It is often used to gather information from fields with preset option lists, such as gender, region, etc.

## Core Features

- **Multi-Column Selector Option List:**
  - **Predefined**: Editable two-dimensional array options list in the component's properties panel.
  - **Dynamic Binding**: Bind a two-dimensional array from the object tree as the options list.
  - **Two-Dimensional Object Array Mode**: Supports filling option lists by adding columns and specifying value fields and display fields.

- **Option Selection for Multi-Column Selector:**
  - When the user selects an option, a selection change event is triggered with an array of options as the event parameter.

## Basic Usage

1. **Option List Setup:**
   - Edit and preset the options for each column using the "Edit List Data" button in the properties panel.
   - Use dynamic binding to set a two-dimensional array from the layout as the data source for the options list.

# Cascading Selector

## Overview

Cascade selectors are used to generate a selection menu containing multiple columns of interrelated options, allowing users to select an option from multiple option lists by clicking. By default, the component displays with a background overlay. Cascade selectors are a special type of multi-column selector; changing the selected option in one level affects the option list in lower levels. The option values return as a one-dimensional array comprising the selected value of each column. Multi-column selectors can be added under parent objects such as foreground, page, container, row, and column, suitable for relative and absolute positioning environments in website systems and mini-programs.

## Use Case

Cascade selectors, as web form components, provide users with a sliding menu form to select multiple related lists for information entry. They are commonly used to collect detailed information such as addresses and dates, which can be divided into multiple options progressively to obtain precise details.

## Basic Usage

### Cascade Selector Option List

1. **Predefined Options:**
   - Click the “Edit List Data” button on the properties panel to open an editing interface for a two-dimensional array.
   - In the cascade selector's list data, the data hierarchy decreases from left to right. Each row of data contains information for all levels. Users need to select the option of the upper level to determine the content of the lower level. For example, data going from province to city to district/county requires selecting Jiangsu province first to show cities within Jiangsu, and selecting Nanjing city to display Nanjing districts/counties.
   - When presetting options, define the total number of rows based on the lowest level option, then fill in the relevant data sequentially.

2. **Dynamically Bind Options:**
   - Click the binding icon on the right side of the “Edit List Data” property box, select a two-dimensional array from the object tree, and the dropdown menu options list will automatically bind to the value of the array.
   - Ensure that the two-dimensional array conforms to manual editing format for correct parsing.

### Option Selection in Cascade Selector

When a user clicks and selects an option, it triggers a selection change event and passes all current options as event parameters. This event parameter is a one-dimensional array, with elements being the current selected values of each column from left to right.

**Note:** Without adding events for showing the selector, clicking the cancel or confirm button will make the selector auto-hide.

## Properties

| Property Name       | Description                                                  |

* Without adding relevant events, clicking cancel or confirm button will automatically hide the selector.

## Further Reading

The implementation of a cascade selector requires selecting the appropriate option data structure based on the application scenario. For example, when dealing with geographical data, define the data format as per actual needs to ensure the data hierarchy is clear, enabling the selector to display and interact correctly by levels. Additionally, developers can enhance user experience through custom styles and other methods."
# Custom Chart

### Overview

**Custom Chart** component allows users to freely add and modify the properties and values of echarts by filling in **Custom Data**. Both custom charts and existing components such as **Bar Line Chart** and **Funnel Chart** use echarts. However, unlike existing chart components that display commonly used attributes for users to modify on the editor panel, custom charts are loaded by passing in a JSON string, allowing users to modify more attributes.

### Use Cases

Custom charts are particularly suitable for scenarios where complex charts need to be drawn and existing components do not meet the requirements. Users can create highly customized charts by utilizing the rich templates provided by the echarts official website and customizing data to meet specific business needs.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Customization**: Supports free customization of various chart properties and values through JSON strings.
- **Quick Implementation**: The desired chart can be displayed with simple settings and minimal operations.

### Basic Usage

1. **Select Chart Model**: First, select the required chart template on the echarts official website.
2. **Obtain Option Content**:
   - After selecting the chart, press F12 on the keyboard to open the console tab of the browser.
   - Enter `var option = {....actual content...}` and press Enter.
   - Enter `JSON.stringify(option)` to obtain the JSON string.

For example, suppose the selected chart data is as follows:

```json
{
  "xAxis": {
    "type": "category",
    "data": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
  },
  "yAxis": {
    "type": "value"
  },
  "series": [
    {
      "data": [820, 932, 901, 934, 1290, 1330, 1320],
      "type": "line"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Convert to JSON String**:

   - After executing `JSON.stringify(option)`, the obtained JSON string is:

   ```
   "{\"xAxis\":{\"type\":\"category\",\"data\":[\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\",\"Sat\",\"Sun\"]},\"yAxis\":{\"type\":\"value\"},\"series\":[{\"data\":[820,932,901,934,1290,1330,1320],\"type\":\"line\"}]}"
   ```
4. **Fill in Custom Data**:

   - Remove the double quotes at the beginning and end of the JSON string, and fill it into the **Custom Data** attribute of the custom chart component to display it in the editor. For example, enter the following value:

   ```
   {"xAxis":{"type":"category","data":["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"]},"yAxis":{"type":"value"},"series":[{"data":[820,932,901,934,1290,1330,1320],"type":"line"}]}
   ```

# Canvas

### Function Overview

The canvas feature in the VisualLogic tool is primarily used to provide simple graphic processing capabilities in applets, particularly for printing content drawn on the canvas as image files. This feature supports exporting canvas content as PNG or JPEG formats, allowing users to perform subsequent image operations and processing.

### Basic Usage

The main function of the canvas is to export its content as an image through different event triggers. In the applet environment, the functionality of printing the canvas is achieved through various method calls for image synthesis and output. Specifically, this involves setting several parameters and invoking specific methods.

### Printing the Canvas

Printing the canvas is the core of this feature, allowing users to choose to output canvas content in different image formats. Specific parameters include:

- **Image Format (imgType):** Users can choose to output images in PNG or JPEG format.
- **Destination Image Scale (destScale):** The scale ratio for images can be set to enhance the clarity of the output image.
- **Image Quality (encoderOptions):** Applicable to JPEG format output, users can input a value between 0 and 1, where 1 denotes the highest quality.
- **Background Color (withBG):** Determines whether the canvas's background color should be included in the output image.

In the applet environment, there are two methods to print the canvas:

1. **Print as Base64 Format:** This method is suitable for embedding image data directly into a webpage.
2. **Use Applet API to Print as a Local Temporary File:** This approach not only facilitates image synthesis but also allows additional parameter settings to enhance image quality. However, this feature is exclusively available in the applet environment.

### Interactive Events

In canvas operations, users can interact with the canvas through specific events, such as the click event:

- **Click Event (click):** Triggered when the user clicks the canvas component or its subcomponents with a mouse or finger, allowing retrieval of the X and Y coordinates of the click position.

### Property Settings

In graphical operations, canvas properties can be adjusted to achieve the desired graphical effects:

- **X Coordinate:** Sets the canvas position within the parent container.
- **Y Coordinate:** Similarly, defines the vertical position.
- **Width:** Sets the width of the canvas, which can be a specific pixel value or a percentage relative to the parent container.
- **Height:** Similar setting as width.
- **Background Color:** Sets the background color of the canvas.
- **Visibility (visible):** Determines whether the canvas component is displayed on the interface.

With the above introduction, users can flexibly implement the canvas functionality in the VisualLogic tool according to their needs, constructing a graphical interface that meets specific application scenarios."
# Object Container

## Overview

An object container is a virtual container whose sole purpose is to help users organize the structure of the object tree. During the application runtime, the object container is entirely "transparent," meaning it does not add any additional elements during application rendering. Its primary function is limited to aiding in organizing the object tree during the editing phase. Object containers can be used in both the frontend and backend development of applications, primarily aiming to simplify the object structure, facilitating future updates and maintenance.

## Use Cases

During application development, there often arises a need to effectively manage numerous objects. Object containers provide a straightforward method to arrange the object tree structure by grouping similar types of objects into the same container or organizing objects by page regions/functions into different containers.

## Core Features

- **Object Grouping**: Place objects into object containers based on type or function.
- **Transparency**: Object containers do not affect page rendering during application runtime.
- **Editing Convenience**: In the editing phase, object containers help developers to see and manage the entire object tree more clearly.

## Basic Usage

When using object containers, users can perform the following steps:

1. **Identify Object Types**: Evaluate all objects in the object tree and determine whether they should be organized by type or function.
2. **Create Object Containers**: Create different object containers during editing to group related objects.
3. **Assign Objects**: Move related objects into corresponding containers to maintain a logically clear organization.
4. **Maintenance and Updates**: During later maintenance, easily adjust and update objects through the structured object containers."
# File API

## Overview

The file system is primarily used for executing actions related to resource uploads or downloads, enabling resource management—from uploading images, files, videos, audio, etc., from the local system or in bulk, to downloading resources.

## Use Cases

File interfaces are widely used in various user data collection or customization scenarios. For example, user profile picture customization requires users to upload images themselves.

## Core Features

- Resource Upload
- Resource Download

## Basic Usage

### Resource Upload

Resource uploads can be categorized into single resource uploads and bulk resource uploads. Basic operations for uploading image, video, audio, and file resources are similar. Here, we will use image resource upload as an example for explanation.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Upload Action

The file interface component does not need to be added to the object tree and can be directly used by selecting it in the event panel actions. For instance, to upload an image upon button click, you can add a click event to the button, select the target object as "file interface," and select the action "upload an image."

#### Step 2: Setting Up Actions to Retrieve Upload Results

- In version 4.1, after executing the file interface upload action, the upload result needs to be retrieved in a callback, including states such as "start upload," "uploading," "upload complete," and "upload failed."
- In version 5.0, the callback block has been removed from the event panel. Instead, a new action block is added after the upload action block to get the upload result. For example, choose the execution object as an image, and the execution action as setting the image resource, then select [uploaded image1.url address] in the resource address selection box.

#### Step 3: Preview and Test

During application preview, test by clicking the button, which will open a local resource browser window to select and upload a local resource. Upon completion, the system will display a popup notification.

### Resource Retrieval

After completing the upload operation, the resource address is temporarily stored in the cache and needs to be accessed or displayed. Suppose a preset blank image is used to display the uploaded image. In that case, the address of that blank image can be set to the resource address of the uploaded image.

Continuing with the above example, add an action after the upload action, select the target object as the preset blank icon, choose the action "set image address," and select the address as [uploaded image].

### Single Resource Download

Specify the file name and resource address for download.

### Batch Download as ZIP

- Method 1: Specify a one-dimensional array of resource addresses, where file names in the downloaded ZIP package are automatically generated hash names.
- Method 2: Specify an object array of resource addresses and file names, providing file addresses and names, with files in the downloaded ZIP package named as specified.

### Batch Download as ZIP (with Subfolders)

When generating and downloading ZIP files containing subfolders, the resource array must include columns id, parentId, name, and url. An empty URL indicates a folder, while a non-empty URL results in downloading the file at the resource address.

## Actions

| Action Name                    | Action Description                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Download File                  | Download a file from a given address.                        |

# Trigger

# Overview

A trigger is a time-triggered component used to repeatedly activate an event or animation effect at equal intervals. When the interval is short enough, it can be perceived as continuous triggering. The trigger can be set with a specific number of activations and time intervals to suit various triggering methods.

## Use Cases

Triggers are commonly used in the following three scenarios:

1. **Timed, Delayed Triggering**: Triggers can achieve a single delayed activation of an action. For example, replaying an animation 2 seconds after it ends.
2. **Equal Interval Triggering**: For timed triggers at equal intervals, triggers offer a more convenient solution than a timeline. For instance, automatically turning a page every 3 seconds can be handled with a trigger for timing and execution.
3. **Continuous Triggering**: By setting frame-by-frame activation, triggers can achieve continuous animation effects. Frames correspond to the smallest unit of the device's display refresh rate, typically a fortieth or sixtieth of a second, making it appear continuous to the human eye.

## Core Functionality

### Basic Usage

1. **Equal Interval Triggering with Triggers**:

   - Activate on a fixed interval, such as a countdown component activating every second. Set the number of activations so that the counter stops decrementing when it reaches zero.
2. **Implementing Animation Effects with Triggers**:

   - Configure the trigger to adjust object properties, such as rotation angle, on each activation to achieve animation effects. It can also execute specific actions at high frequencies.

| Property Name          | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Play Count             | The maximum number of times the trigger plays, default is unlimited. |
| Time Interval          | The time interval between two activations, usually a fortieth or sixtieth of a second, matching device refresh rates. |
| Auto Play              | Controls whether the trigger auto-plays, with the default set to off. |
| Animation Optimization | Enables optimization by adjusting refresh rates during animation, using fixed interval triggers when off. Applicable in mini-game environments only. |

## Actions

| Action Name | Description                                                  |

## Further Reading

When used to implement complex functionalities, triggers provide a variety of configurations to cater to different application scenarios. By configuring play counts, intervals, and auto-play features, users can customize the required animation and functional mechanisms."
# Action Group

## Overview
The Action Group component is located on the right side of the editor, aligned with Events and Action Groups. An Action Group consists of multiple actions, containing a series of target objects and target actions. Action Groups package commonly repeated logic in the project, allowing for the invocation of complex logic by calling the Action Group. This effectively reduces project complexity and enhances maintainability. Reasonable planning of the packaging hierarchy of Action Groups can make the main logic of events clearer and enhance the readability of project logic.

## Use Cases
A typical use case is placing the logic for WeChat login and retrieving and assigning user information into an Action Group named "WeChat Login": this Action Group can be invoked during frontend initialization and other event triggers.

## Core Functions
### Parameterless Action Groups
This is the most basic usage of Action Groups, encapsulating multiple reusable actions into one Action Group, neither receiving nor returning parameters. For example, initializing all actions on a page, including fetching the time, clearing each input box, resetting data, etc.

### Parameterized Action Groups
If the Action Group involves data calculations, raw data can be passed as "input parameters" into the Action Group, and the calculation results can be returned as "output parameters" at the end of the Action Group. For instance, converting a Unix timestamp into a routinely usable time format; the timestamp is an input parameter, and the processed date and time are output parameters.

## Basic Usage
### Synchronous and Asynchronous Action Groups
Similar to function components, Action Groups can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous invocation, the action blocks following an Action Group will wait until the current Action Group completes execution before executing; in asynchronous invocation, the following action blocks will execute once the current Action Group begins execution. Asynchronous invocation of Action Groups can prevent subsequent action blocks from being blocked by the current Action Group.

### Example Explanation
#### Example 1: Synchronous Action Group
1. Add components: Add a button component and two Action Groups under the frontend directory, and add an event to the button component.
2. Edit the synchronous Action Group: Have the synchronous Action Group return the string "Synchronous Action Group" directly, and toggle the "Synchronous" switch at the top of the Action Group panel.
3. Edit event logic: For the button's click event, the asynchronous Action Group will not block the execution of the subsequent "Synchronous Action Group" and "Application System" action blocks. The string returned by the asynchronous Action Group will be printed last.

#### Example 2: Asynchronous Action Group
1. Add components: Same as the synchronous Action Group.
2. Edit the asynchronous Action Group: Have the asynchronous Action Group wait two seconds before returning the string "Asynchronous Action Group", leaving the "Synchronous" switch off.
3. Edit event logic: Same as the synchronous Action Group, the string returned by the asynchronous Action Group will be printed last.

### Multiple Returns and Interruptions
Typically, an Action Group only requires one "Set Return Result" statement, usually at the end of the Action Group, and stops upon return. When there are multiple return statements inside an Action Group, a synchronously called Action Group will interrupt after executing the first encountered return statement, while an asynchronously called Action Group will continue executing all return statements that meet conditions.

#### Synchronous Action Group
Edit the Action Group logic and toggle the "Synchronous" switch at the top of the Action Group panel, returning "0" at the first loop iteration will interrupt the Action Group.

#### Asynchronous Action Group
If the "Synchronous" switch is off, the Action Group will sequentially return "0", "1", "2", and "10".

## Properties
| Property Name     | Description                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Parameters  | External input data parameters received by the Action Group |
| Output Parameters | Output data parameters processed by the Action Group        |

## Actions
| Action Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invoke Action Group | This action is used to trigger the execution of the Action Group |
| Set Return Result   | Sets the result to be returned after the Action Group execution is complete |

## Events
| Event Name   | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Action Start | Triggered when the Action Group starts execution |

# Custom Function

### Overview
Custom functions are a core feature in the VisualLogic tool, allowing developers to create their own functions as needed to implement complex logic processing. The use of custom functions involves several aspects, including basic usage, synchronous and asynchronous calls, multiple returns and interruptions, handling different return types, and integrating external libraries.

### Basic Usage
Similar to action groups, function components can be used with or without parameters. Many direct operations on the DOM can be performed without setting parameters, such as deleting a black stripe. However, when operating on variables or objects within the current project, it is usually necessary to set input and return parameters. For example, clicking a button to transpose a 2D array takes `matrix` as an input parameter and `res` and `note` as return parameters.

It is important to note that the naming of input and return parameters must adhere to JavaScript syntax rules, i.e., characters can only be letters, underscores, dollar signs, or numbers, are case-sensitive, and cannot begin with a number.

### Core Features

#### Synchronous Functions and Asynchronous Functions
The way functions are called determines the waiting relationship between the function component's action block and the next action block in the event panel, categorized into synchronous and asynchronous calls. In synchronous calls, the next action block waits for the current function to complete before executing. In asynchronous calls, the next action block executes once the current function begins execution.

The difference between synchronous and asynchronous lies in whether the execution of the current function blocks subsequent code execution. For instance, when requesting data from the backend, a network delay could increase the time taken. If subsequent logic is not affected by the request result, asynchronous function execution should be chosen to avoid blocking subsequent logic.

**Example Explanation:**
1. **Adding Components**: Add a button component and two function components in the frontend directory and add an event to the button component.
2. **Editing a Synchronous Function**: Have the synchronous function directly return the string "Synchronous function is executing".
3. **Editing an Asynchronous Function**: Have the asynchronous function return the string "Asynchronous function is executing" after a two-second wait.
4. **Editing Event Logic**: Set the button click event; the asynchronous function will not block the execution of the subsequent "Synchronous function" and "System" action blocks.

#### Multiple Returns and Interruptions
Typically, a function has only one return statement, generally at the end of the function body, which stops execution upon return. When there are multiple return statements within the function, a synchronously called function will interrupt upon the first return statement executed, whereas an asynchronously called function will execute all return statements that meet the conditions.

#### Handling Different Return Types
Asynchronous functions may return different content depending on the situation, and a new output parameter can be set as a condition check. For example, returning content every second and processing different logic based on the type of the return value, using the output parameter to determine the return type.

### Advanced Usage

#### Integrating External Libraries
JS libraries can be introduced into a VisualLogic project by inserting `<link>` or `<script>` nodes into the DOM. For example, by inserting a `<link>` node to use the weUI styling library in the project:

1. **Choosing a weUI Style**: Locate the "Primary Button" on the weUI official site.
2. **Adding Components**: Add rows, buttons, and function components in the frontend directory, and add events to the button component.
3. **Editing Additional Element Classes**: Add element classes related to button styling to the extra element class properties of the row and button components.
4. **Editing the Function**: Edit the function to add a `<link>` tag inside the `<head>`, setting the tag's `rel`, `type`, and `href` attributes.
5. **Calling the Function**: Synchronously call this function in the button's event panel.

When running the program, clicking the button will change its style.

### Properties

# Boolean variable

### Overview

Boolean variables are an important data type in programming, corresponding to the Boolean type in JavaScript, with values having only two states: `true` or `false`. A common function of Boolean variables is to evaluate the truthiness of a value. This type is widely used in scenarios requiring true/false judgments.

### Use cases

Boolean variables have a wide range of applications. Although text variables or numeric variables can be set to 0 and 1 to perform similar Boolean evaluations, this approach lacks intuitiveness. In scenarios that require truthiness evaluation, using Boolean variables helps improve the maintainability of the project.

### Core functionality

- **Value determination**: Boolean variables only have two states: `true` or `false`.
- **Judgment basis**: Boolean variables can be used for conditional judgments, such as controlling flow and executing logic branches.

### Basic usage

1. **Data binding**: When the attribute type is also Boolean, it is recommended to use Boolean variables for data binding. For instance, in an option with a Boolean type attribute, it can be visible or invisible; Boolean variables can be used for data binding in such cases.
2. **Event style adjustment**: When handling events like mouse enter, leave, or click, Boolean variables can be used in conjunction with ternary expressions to change styles, such as altering the background color before and after a mouse enters a button.

### Actions

| Action Name  | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Assignment   | Assign a value to a Boolean variable, which can be any value, with truthiness determined by specific rules. For example: non-empty, non-zero is `true`, `null`, `undefined`, 0 are `false`. |
| Set to true  | Set the Boolean variable to `true`.                          |
| Set to false | Set the Boolean variable to `false`.                         |
| Print value  | Output the current value of the Boolean variable for monitoring dynamic changes of the variable. |

### Events

| Event Name  | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data change | Triggered when the variable data changes; continuous variable value settings will trigger only once. |

### Properties

| Property Name | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value         | Corresponds to the value with the switch being on `true` or off `false`. |

### Notices

- When setting the Boolean variable values multiple times in succession, the "data change" event will only be triggered once to ensure precision in event listening.
- After the assignment operation, printing the current value can be used for debugging and observing variable changes.

### Further Reading

For a deeper understanding of Boolean variables, consider the following points:

- **Practical cases**: Explore how to implement conditional rendering and other functions by combining Boolean variables and events in dynamic web pages.
- **Optimize project maintenance**: Enhance code readability and maintainability by flexibly applying Boolean variables in the project.

Apply Boolean variables flexibly to code segments that require elementary logic judgments based on your project needs."
# Object array

## Overview

Object arrays and two-dimensional arrays are essentially both arrays. In terms of functionality, there is a slight difference in how they are referenced: two-dimensional arrays are referenced by indices, while object arrays are referenced by key names. This mechanism makes object arrays more intuitive and less error-prone when locating specific elements, as it eliminates the need for complex judgments based on element indices.

The element entry and functional attributes of object arrays are fundamentally the same as those of two-dimensional arrays, except that object arrays do not have default row and column numbers. This difference grants object arrays greater flexibility in operations.

## Use Cases

Object arrays are often used in data processing scenarios where data complexity is high, and frequent key name operations are required. For example, when we wish to retrieve a particular field (like a name) from a user's record, object arrays allow us to access the target data directly via the key name, without having to remember its corresponding index at some location. This trait makes them very suitable for data processing tasks that require high readability and ease of operation.

## Basic Usage

### Creating Object Arrays

Object arrays can be created through the VisualLogic tool's component bar on the left side of the editor. After creation, you can perform basic operations as follows:

#### Import Structure

- Commonly used to export data from the backend database for use in the frontend.
- Upon selecting and importing a database, all fields become fields in the object array.

#### Assign Value

- Manually input or import data, often used for setting and editing the object array.
- Directly assigning values from an object array or a generic variable array to the current object array is very common.

#### Operate Columns

- Columns can be deleted or added via key name operations.
- Note that default values need to be set uniformly during print display.

#### Add Data

- Add one or multiple rows of data to the object array, supporting insertion at the beginning or end, ensuring key names are consistent.

#### Delete Data

- Supports clearing array data, deleting specified rows, removing duplicates, and deleting specific columns.

#### Set Value

- You can set the value of a specific element using row number, column number, or column name.

#### Data Statistics and Query

- Supports operations like summing or averaging a column, requiring numeric types or string numbers.

## Attributes

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Print Current Value                  | Outputs the current value of the object array, useful for testing. |
| Assign Value                         | Assigns overall value to the array, which can be in the form of an object array or a generic variable array structure. |
| Clear                                | Clears array data while retaining the structure.             |

# Time Variable

### Overview

Time variables are often used to handle time and convert it into the desired time structure. These variables allow users to flexibly manage and use time information in different scenarios.

### Core Features

- **Dynamic Time Processing**: By setting different formats and units, time variables can dynamically process and output time information.
- **Flexible Assignment**: Supports multiple assignment methods, including timestamp, year/month/day/hour/minute/second, etc.
- **Data Binding**: Allows dynamic updating and invocation of time variables through data binding.

### Basic Usage

1. **Adding Time Variables**: Users can directly add time variables in the editing interface.
2. **Assigning Time Variables**:

   - In edit mode, you can directly input an initial value in the "Date" property column, with the system defaulting to the current time.
   - In non-edit mode, you can dynamically assign values through the "Assign" action or data binding. Non-edit mode assignments include the following three scenarios:

     - **Assign-Timestamp (milliseconds)**: Only supports timestamp format; if other time formats are input, the default time is displayed.
     - **Assign-(year/month/day/hour/minute/second)**: Receives specific values for each time unit.
     - **Assign-(year month day/hour minute second)**: Receives formatted strings.
3. **Binding Time Variables**: Once assigned, time variables can be bound (invoked) where needed.
4. **Clearing Time Variables**: If a time variable has been assigned or a default value is set in the formula editor, executing the clear action will reset its value to the default value when missing, i.e., the current time.

### Properties

# General Variable

## Overview

Universal Variables are data variables of the Object type with an initial value of an empty object `{ }`. They are structured data variables used to store multi-level structured data. When using Universal Variables, you can manually structure the data by adding nodes or import data in JSON format to have the system automatically generate nodes at each level. For example, the following data structure:

```json
{
  "employees": [
    { "firstName": "Zhang", "lastName": "San" },
    { "firstName": "Li", "lastName": "Si" },
    { "firstName": "Wang", "lastName": "Wu" }
  ]
}
```

In this example, "employees" is an array containing three objects, each providing the first and last names of employees. Universal Variables also support JSON data import, automatically parsing its structure and creating corresponding variables. This variable can be invoked through loop-enabled components, similar to two-dimensional array operations.

## Use Cases

Universal Variables are suitable for storing and manipulating complex, multi-level data structures, especially when there is a need to dynamically generate and manipulate data involving multiple levels and relationships. Creating multi-level cascading dropdown menus is a good use case.

## Core Features

Universal Variables support the following features:

- **Manual Node Addition**: Easily create data nodes through a simple interactive interface.
- **JSON Data Import**: Directly import JSON structures to automatically generate variables.
- **Dynamic Value Invocation**: Dynamically generate and manipulate data through loop-created components.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Manual Node Addition

- Click the "+Root Node" button to add a root node.
- After setting the root node, a dropdown can be used to set the node type, and an "object" node can continue to add child nodes.

### 2. JSON Data Import

- After importing JSON data, Universal Variables will automatically parse its structure. Use the "Import JSON" button in the properties interface to paste data and confirm the import.

### 3. Using Loops to Create Components

- Use text controls combined with Universal Variables for data binding. In binding, select a specific data path to output corresponding data within the text.

## Q&A

**Q: How to create a multi-level cascading dropdown menu?**

A: A multi-level cascading dropdown menu can be achieved through Universal Variables and nested loop-created components. Set up Universal Variables to store multi-level data structures, use loop components to dynamically generate menu options, and control linkage effects through conditions.

# Object Variable

## Overview

An object variable is a single-row, multi-column variable that can be referenced by key names. You can think of it as a one-dimensional object array. Essentially, it is a variable that can hold multiple data types, allowing programs to use and manipulate it in different scenarios. This type of variable is very common in data processing and manipulation.

## Use Cases

Object variables are suitable for scenarios requiring the dynamic operation of structured data, such as when you need to frequently perform create, read, update, and delete operations on data. Using object variables can make these operations more flexible. They can serve as temporary data storage carriers and can also be used for data interaction with backend databases.

## Core Features

The core features of object variables include:

- Single-row, multi-column structure: Data can be accessed and manipulated via key names.
- Supports dynamic operations: Includes adding, deleting, updating fields, assigning values, and clearing values.

## Basic Usage

1. **Assignment**

   - **Edit Data**: Select the object variable and click on edit data to create the needed fields.
   - **Import Structure**: After selecting the object variable, choose the structure from the desired database for import.
   - **Direct Assignment**: Directly assign specific data or structure to the object variable.
   
2. **Actions**

   - **Delete Field**: Remove a specified field.
   - **Add Field**: Add a new field.
   - **Modify Field Name**: Rename an existing field.
   - **Set Field Value**: Update the value of a specific field.
   - **Clone Structure**: Clone the structure (column names and types) of another object variable to the current object variable.

| # Canvas    |                                                              |

## Overview

The 2D Canvas Component is the root component of the 2D canvas environment, and under it, three types of page components can be added: Scene, Classic Physics World, and Advanced Physics World. All other UI and functional components need to be added under the page. The 2D Canvas Component defines the position and size of the entire canvas in the web, as well as some basic configuration options such as render mode, frame rate limit, etc. These configuration options help users customize the behavior and appearance of the canvas.

## Use Cases

The 2D Canvas Component is suitable for all root components of 2D canvas environments and can be widely used in game development, animation production, and other scenarios requiring 2D graphics rendering. Specifically, it is applicable to applications that need to display 2D graphics on web platforms.

## Core Features

### Render Mode

The 2D Canvas Component supports setting the render mode of the entire canvas with three main options:

- **webgl**: Uses the browser-provided WebGL API to accelerate graphics rendering using GPU resources.
- **canvas**: Uses the HTML5 canvas API, relatively simple functionality but better compatibility.
- **auto**: Default value, uses WebGL if the browser supports it, otherwise uses canvas.

**Note**: The webgl mode is limited by the browser's underlying interface and does not support displaying images with a width or height greater than 4096px. To display large images, they can be cropped and then stitched. Additionally, webgl mode may cause abnormal flickering on some Huawei phones. Switch to canvas mode to resolve this issue.

### Canvas Resolution

Currently, the Phaser engine does not support dynamically setting canvas resolution, so the resolution of the current application needs to be decided before development. It is recommended to set the stage and canvas size to 720px wide on mobile devices instead of the system default 375px to improve image clarity. For PAD devices, it can be set according to the PAD resolution.

### Performance Panel

Displays a data panel monitoring performance in the canvas, including frame rate and other performance data for application debugging. The performance panel can be freely dragged to different positions.

## Basic Usage

### Initialize the 2D Canvas Component

Create a 2D Canvas Component in a relatively positioned environment and set necessary properties such as render mode, width, and height.

### Set Preloading

The 2D Canvas Component can manage the preloading progress of all page components under it. Enable the resource preloading attribute to participate in the canvas initialization preloading process and throw the loading progress of resources in all pages through the "Resource Loading" event.

## Advanced Usage

### Page Navigation

By calling the m_switchScene method, page navigation can be achieved. Users can set the background color, duration, target page, etc., for the transition animation.

### Print Canvas

Using the m_toDataURL method, the canvas content can be saved as an image format, and the return value is the base64 encoded image data.

# Page

## Overview

A page is a common pagination unit component that can divide a certain area into multiple stacked pages for a flipping presentation. As the basic structural unit of a case, pages can optimize the content display structure through reasonable layout, making the content more organized.

## Use Cases

When the case content contains multiple content modules, the page component can be used to distinguish these modules. For example, it can be used to showcase product features, multi-step processes, etc. The page component helps users understand information more clearly through flipping.

## Core Features

### 1. Adding Pages

Pages can be added under parent objects like the front end or containers (object groups) but cannot be added under rows, columns, banners, panels, layers, etc. To add a page, select the parent object first and then click on the page component to add. The order of addition determines the display order of pages, and pages can be reordered in the object tree by dragging and dropping.

### 2. Switching Pages

Switching between pages needs to be triggered by events, such as swipe-flip, scroll-flip, click-flip, etc. Different trigger conditions can achieve the corresponding flipping effects. For instance, you can set page 1 to jump to the next page on left swipe by adding an event to page 1 and selecting the target action as "jump to next page." To jump to a specific page, use the "jump to page" action.

### 3. Page Animation Settings

In the H5 environment, users can define different entrance and exit effects for each page. The system provides rich page-turning animation effects. If not specifically set, no animation effects are added by default.

## Properties

| Property Name       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Background Color    | The background color of the current component.               |
| Resource Preloading | Preload image resources and selected audio resources during the loading phase to enhance the real-time display of pages, but it will extend loading time and increase memory usage. |

## Actions

| Any Direction Swipe | Triggered when a swipe ends in any direction within the range of the component. |
| Finger Up Outside   | Triggered when a finger-up action is detected outside the component range. |

## Notes

- Use resource preloading with caution, as it can improve display immediacy but will increase loading time and device memory usage.
- Adjust the trigger conditions for events during page setup to achieve the desired page-switching effects."
# Object Group

### Overview

Object groups are tools for managing objects, primarily including functionalities such as adding child objects, performing unified operations on child objects, and copying and creating child objects. With object groups, multiple different objects can be managed uniformly, enabling efficient design and management workflows.

### Usage Scenarios

When you need to perform unified operations on multiple different objects, you can utilize object groups. By placing multiple objects within an object group, you can perform operations on them collectively. Additionally, object groups allow for duplicating child objects according to specified rules.

### Core Features

- **Add Child Objects**: New child objects can be added within an object group for centralized management.
- **Unified Operations**: Perform unified transformations and operations on child objects to improve work efficiency.
- **Duplicate Child Objects**: Duplicate and create new child objects based on attributes and rules of the objects.

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Create an Object Group

- Select the canvas and click the "Object Group" button on the left toolbar.
- Draw the desired size object group in the editing area, which will serve as a container for child objects.

#### 2. Add Child Objects to the Object Group

- The steps to add child objects in an object group are similar to adding objects on the canvas.
- The position of child objects is determined by X, Y coordinate values relative to the object group and can exceed the visual boundaries of the object group.

#### 3. Create Objects

- The object group can execute the "Create Object" operation to duplicate child objects. For instance, if you need to duplicate an image at random positions within an object group, follow these steps:
  1. Set up a 500*500 object group and add the image object to be duplicated (e.g., 60*60 in size).
  2. Add a button to trigger the "Copy Object" action.
  3. Use two variables to control the X, Y values of the duplicated object.
  4. Click the button to trigger duplication, and the image will be created at a random position within the object group.
  5. To ensure the new object is within the object group, set the X, Y value range between 0 and 440.

### Properties

| Property Name    | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Background Color | Background color of the object group. |

### Actions

# Banner

## Overview

The banner component is a specialized positioning tool that maintains a fixed position on a scrolling page, not scrolling with the page. It is often used to fix floating buttons or text and image content above the page, such as back-to-top buttons, customer service answer buttons, and text and image ads. The banner itself is a container that can fix all objects within it at a specific position on the page.

Banner components are divided into two types: absolute positioning and relative positioning. An absolute positioning banner embeds an absolutely positioned container, while a relative positioning banner embeds a relatively positioned row container. Despite the different positioning rules of the internal elements, the positioning and usage methods of both banners are completely identical.

## Core Functions

- **Overall Layout**: The banner can be set to a fixed position relative to the browser window, not changing its position with page scrolling. On the basis of the overall layout, the precise position can be adjusted via horizontal and vertical offsets.
- **Background Overlay**: The banner provides a background overlay function, commonly applied to create pop-ups or alerts. The background overlay provides a "click overlay" event, which can be used to hide the banner when clicking on the overlay.

## Basic Properties

### Attributes

For example, creating a customer service dialog on the page that hides when a user clicks outside the dialog, with overlay events triggering, can also set certain animation effects for a smoother user experience.

## Further Reading

To further understand how to use the banner component to achieve complex layouts and interaction effects, you can refer to relevant practice cases and tutorials or consult the official VisualLogic tool documentation for more detailed guidance."
# Scale Container

## Function Overview

The scaling container is a specialized layout component, whose core functionality lies in controlling the overall size of the container and its internal elements by setting a scaling ratio. Its essence is to change the perceived size by altering the object's `transform` property rather than directly changing the component size. Compared to directly adjusting the dimensions of DOM elements, this method does not lead to DOM tree reflow and repaint, thereby offering significant performance advantages.

## Use Cases

Scaling containers are suitable for embedding within absolutely positioned containers or canvases, especially in animation scenarios where dynamic size changes of objects are required. In such scenarios, scaling containers can efficiently adjust the size of objects within animations.

## Basic Usage

When using scaling containers, it is important to pay attention to the following properties:

- **Actual Width and Height** (`actualWidth`, `actualHeight`): The actual width and height are derived from the product of the "original width and height" and the "scaling ratio".
- **Original Width and Height** (`shapeWidth`, `shapeHeight`): These serve as the baseline values for setting the scaling container's dimensions. When the width scale ratio or height scale ratio is 1, the original width and height are the actual display dimensions of the container.
- **Width Scale Ratio** (`scaleX`) and **Height Scale Ratio** (`scaleY`): These properties determine the expansion or contraction ratio of the component and its internal elements when displayed. The larger the scaling ratio, the larger the actual size of the elements.

### Display Rules

1. **Actual Width and Height Calculation**
   `Actual Width = Original Width * Width Scale Ratio`
   `Actual Height = Original Height * Height Scale Ratio`
2. **Scaling Ratio Settings**
   Generally, it is recommended to maintain the original width and height as fixed values and achieve size changes of the container and its sub-elements by adjusting the actual width, height, or scaling ratio.
3. **Adding Animations**
   In animation effects, changing any set of parameters in the actual width, height, or scaling ratio at keyframes is sufficient without altering the basic original dimensions.

By reasonably setting these properties, scaling containers can flexibly adapt to various size adjustment needs and achieve efficient size transformation effects. This method ensures superior page performance while enabling dynamic changes in complex scenarios."
# Polygon

## Overview
The polygon component is utilized to draw a polygon shape on the canvas. It has the following features:
- Customizable polygon shape drawing;
- Ability to set fill color and border color;
- Dynamic drawing through properties such as height, width, origin, and origin position.

## Use Cases
1. **Draw Polygons**  
   Upon adding a polygon, the drawing interface will automatically pop up. You can draw the polygon by clicking to define its corners within the box. To modify the polygon's shape, you can reopen the drawing interface by selecting "Edit Shape" in its property panel and click "Redraw Polygon" to clear the previous shape and start drawing a new one.

2. **Button**  
   Since polygons support click events, they can be styled and used as uniquely shaped buttons.

3. **Overlap Detection**
   By adding to different object groups, use stacking events to detect overlapping and separation between objects.

4. **Polygon Mask**
   Set other components' mask objects to a polygon to create a polygon mask effect, whereby only the content inside the polygon is displayed.

## Core Functions

# Text

## Overview

The Text Component is used to insert text objects for recording and displaying a segment of text. It offers the following fundamental features:

- Allows defining the appearance of text with basic typography.
- Text content can be set to an initial value or dynamically defined. You can retrieve system component properties, service return data, and user behavior data (such as click position, scroll speed, etc.) through the formula editor, and perform data calculations using formulas.
- Suitable for non-Chinese text or Chinese text without font. If you need to use Chinese fonts with font styles, it is recommended to import external image assets.
- Suitable for plain text data. If you need formatted text or mixed text and images, it is recommended to use a rich text tool.

## Use Cases

Text objects are commonly used to display a segment of text in scenarios where the content can be predefined or derived from system component properties, computation results (such as user input values), etc. Therefore, they are often used in various dynamic data display and recording scenarios.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Text Content Setup

#### (1) Initial Value Setup for Text Content

In the editing state, you can enter the initial text content through the "Content" field in the properties box.

#### (2) Dynamic Setup for Text Content

Components on the canvas cannot use data binding, so the text content can be dynamically defined through assignment. For example, if we want to set a text content to "Body Text", it can execute an "Assignment" action where the value is directly set to "Body Text".

# Chinese Fonts

## Overview

Due to the inability to specify Chinese fonts in browsers, we provide a Chinese Font Component that can convert input text into images in real-time on the backend. Therefore, Chinese fonts are essentially images, not text. These fonts support dynamic assignment during application runtime. However, since the Chinese fonts are essentially not text, their content is not rendered in real-time via frontend data (but through backend-generated images returned), their values cannot be data-bound and can only be set via assignment actions.

## Use Cases

The Chinese Font Component is suitable for scenarios where custom Chinese fonts need to be used in web applications. For example, a web design that wishes to display a specific Chinese font effect can achieve this by using the Chinese Font Component.

## Core Features

### Upload and Use Fonts

In the "Text Font" option of the attribute panel, you can upload custom font files. Once uploaded, you will see the latest font option in the font panel, allowing you to select and use that font.

### Dynamic Assignment

Chinese font assignment means regenerating the font image from the backend. You can use completion callbacks to determine if the font has been fully generated.

## Basic Usage

### Initial Value Content

In edit mode, you can enter the initial text content through the "Text Content" field in the property box.

### Dynamic Text Content Setting

You can dynamically define text content by setting the "Text Content" property. For example, if you want to set certain text content to other content:

Note: When setting text content, if the content is of numeric type, it should be enclosed in quotes, like "1234567," otherwise the system will throw an error.

### Trigger Events

Trigger events "Content Changed" and "Image URL Changed." Content Changed is triggered only when the text content changes; Image URL Changed includes changes in content and font style.

## Properties

| Property Name | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Content       | Current text content, default is Text.       |

# Image

### Overview

The image component under the canvas is used to insert images into the current canvas. It has the following basic features:
- Supports image formats such as jpg, jpeg, png, and gif, and using GIF native animations can achieve some simple animation effects.
- Adjustable size, position, and appearance attributes.
- Image assets can be uploaded locally or accessed from the web using URL or Base64. By redefining the "asset resource address" property, the image asset can be replaced without altering its current properties.
- Images under the canvas have special attributes of the canvas, including masking and allowing drag-and-drop.

### Use Cases

Images, as the most widely used media materials, are commonly used in the following scenarios:
- As background images.
- As animation objects.
- As interactive objects.
- As page decorations.

### Core Features

#### Replace Image Assets

When adding an image component, the system will automatically pop up a file selector to upload an image from the local to the VisualLogic server as the source of the image asset. You can also replace the image asset by resetting the "asset resource address" property, which only changes the image asset without altering its size, position, and other properties.

**Images in Edit Mode**

- Local re-upload: If you want to re-upload an image from local to replace the current asset, simply click the upload image icon next to "asset resource address" to bring up the upload window.
- Double-click replacement: Double-click the image on the stage or double-click the image object's icon in the object tree to re-upload a local image.

**Images in Non-Edit Mode**

During case execution, image assets need to be replaced through events, for example:
- Use the "Set Image Address" event to reset the address property of the image to be replaced to the target resource address.
- Use the "System" component's upload image action, then reset the image address in the callback.

#### Drag Image

To achieve the effect of holding and dragging an image to another position in the case, the "allow dragging" property of the image can be set.
- Edit Click Boundary: Define the draggable area of the editable image.
- Set Allow Drag Direction: Set the image "allow dragging" property to "any direction".

#### Mask

Images under the canvas support masking effects. In the image's "mask object" property, select the corresponding object for masking operations.

### Basic Usage

#### Scenario One: Replace Image Assets

1. Add an image component, and the system will automatically bring up a file selector to choose and upload a local image.
2. Replace the current image at any time through the "asset resource address" property.

#### Scenario Two: Replace Image via Events

1. Use the "Set Image Address" event in the event to change the image.
2. If you need to upload a new image to replace the current one, you can use the "System" component upload image action and set the new address after the callback.

#### Scenario Three: Implement Image Drag

1. Set the image's "allow dragging" property to "any direction".
2. Edit click boundary to define the trigger area for dragging.

#### Scenario Four: Image Masking

1. In the editing interface, select the mask object for the image.

# Image Sequence

## Overview

The image sequence component is designed to manage and display an ordered set of image assets. During playback, images are displayed sequentially, with only one image shown at any given time. The transition to the next (or previous) image occurs after certain time intervals. If images are contiguous and displayed rapidly, it creates an effect similar to animation or video due to the persistence of vision. This component supports image packages in GIF or ZIP formats, which the system automatically decompresses into individual images. It allows reordering of images and customization of the display duration for each image. Multiple image sequences can be added to each image object component, but only one sequence can be played at any time, and the sequence to be played can be specified.

## Use Cases

The image sequence component is suitable for the following scenarios:

- **Image Group Display**: Automatically play a set of images for multi-image display.
- **Simulate Video or Animation Effects**: Due to the limitations of mobile device players, image sequences can replace videos when high video quality is not required, offering smoother playback and richer interaction options.

## Core Features

- Support for extracting images from GIF or ZIP format packages.
- Customization of image order and playback duration.
- Single component supports multiple image sequence management.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Adding an Image Sequence

- Click the image sequence button on the left toolbar of the canvas to define the size of the image sequence in the editing area.
- Upload the image sequence to be added.

### 2. Editing the Image Sequence

- Click the "Edit Image List" button in the image sequence properties to enter the editing interface.
- The uploaded image sequence will automatically be split into individual frames.
- Delete images: Click the "×" button at the top-right corner of the image to delete the current image. Select one or more images for bulk deletion via the "Delete Selected Images" button.

## Overview

The Audio Component is used to insert an audio asset and monitor and control its playback behavior. VisualLogic supports audio files up to 50MB in size. Due to limitations in browser environments, using the wav format may not work properly in some cases; it is recommended to convert all audio assets to mp3 format. Audio assets are accessed via resource URLs, allowing for the replacement of audio assets without altering the playback properties of the audio object.

## Use Cases

Audio is typically used to add background music or sound effects. Sound effects vary based on the use case and are categorized as notification effects or performance effects. Sound effects can either play automatically or be controlled through events or triggers to determine their timing.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Definition of Audio Properties

The audio properties panel allows you to control the audio volume, playback speed, mute state, and whether to display playback controls. These properties can be set in the editing state or dynamically configured via "Set Properties" when not in editing mode. In mini-program or mini-game environments, the audio component also includes a "Preview" attribute.

### 2. Audio Playback Control

Audio playback control can be achieved through the following two methods:

- **Method 1: Use Default Controls**

  Enabling "Show Default Controls" in the audio properties allows users to view audio information and control audio playback and pause through these controls.
  
- **Method 2: Event Control**

  Control audio playback and pause through events, or toggle playback state via play/pause. For example, design a simple audio control button using an icon. When the play button is clicked, audio playback starts, the button hides, and the pause button is shown; when the pause button is clicked, the audio pauses, the button hides, and the play button is shown.

### 3. Replace Audio Assets

Audio assets can be replaced by resetting the audio address. Coupled with the system's upload audio action, user-defined audio can be achieved.

# Particle Effects

## Overview

Particle effects are a technique used in computer graphics to simulate specific phenomena, enabling realistic and naturally random special effects such as explosions, fireworks, and water flow. Particle effects are typically used to mimic complex natural phenomena that are difficult to represent with simple time-sequence frames.

## Use Cases

Particle effects are particularly suitable for scenarios requiring the simulation of numerous particles in motion and varying states, such as water flow and explosions. These effects are often hard to achieve with traditional animation techniques, but a particle system can simulate more realistic and natural visual effects.

## Core Features

A particle system simulates various physical phenomena by setting different attributes and generation methods. Users can achieve specific visual effects by adjusting properties like the generation range, preset effects, initial velocity, and lifetime of particles. Additionally, particle systems support dynamic adjustment of effect parameters, allowing modifications to particle attributes at runtime for more complex renderings.

## Basic Usage

Familiarity with the panel attributes is essential before using particle effects. The general steps for using particle effects are as follows:

1. **Preset Panel Attributes:**
   - Pre-configure the panel attributes of the particle effect based on the required outcome.
   - Open the playback options of the panel attributes to observe and adjust preset effects, providing real-time preview adjustments.

2. **Dynamically Set Particle Attributes:**
   - Select the particle effect as the target in events.
   - Dynamically change particle effects through event-generated parameters or direct adjustments of panel attributes. For instance, to create a fountain effect, increase the initial velocity of particles to reflect the height of the water column.

3. **Dynamically Create Particle Effects:**
   - Dynamically create particle effects at specified locations as needed.
   - Use the copy object event of object groups to create new effects and adjust all panel attributes during creation to produce completely new particle effects.

## Advanced Usage

In complex scenarios, multiple attribute settings and event operations might be required to generate more intricate particle effects. These advanced usages demand comprehensive knowledge of particle system properties.

## Properties

# Skeletal Animation

## Overview

Skeletal animation is a model animation technique that achieves animation effects through a skeleton structure composed of interconnected "bones". The skeletal animation data is stored in JSON format, and animation is generated by calculating changes in bones in real time. Although this method has high computational demands, it allows for quicker and more convenient creation of vivid animation effects. Skeletal animation offers convenient re-outfitting effects and combined animation effects, such as executing attack actions while a character moves. Compared to traditional image sequence or timeline animation tools, skeletal animation is more efficient and less resource-intensive when creating complex animations.

## Use Cases

Skeletal animation is suitable for scenarios requiring complex animation effects, especially those needing combined animations, such as when a character moves while performing other actions. Although the production cost is higher than traditional animation methods, its application is widespread in character movement, attack actions, and skill effects. When skeletal animation creates a performance bottleneck, other methods can be used to convert it into simple image sequences.

## Core Features

Skeletal animation consists of two parts: bones and skinning. Bones act as the driving structure of the animation, changing the model's shape. Skinning technology binds the model's vertices to the bones, specifying the influence ratio of different bones on each vertex, ensuring that the model can present natural animation effects with bone movement.

## Basic Usage

### Core Concepts

Skeletal animation primarily involves bones and skinning. Bones are the structure used to drive model changes, while skinning binds the model's vertices to the bones, allowing the model to change with the bone movements. During animation calculations, the influence ratio of each bone's transformation matrix on the vertices is computed to determine the model's final structure.

### Production Process

It is recommended to use DragonBonesPro for creating skeletal animations. This software is designed specifically for 2D game animation, suitable for designers. Upon completing the animation creation, export the files as a ZIP package, containing the JSON file depicting animation and the texture data. Then, import the ZIP package into the VisualLogic editor to finish the application setup of the skeletal animation and adjust its properties.

### Usage Methods

The use of skeletal animation can be divided into two types: pure display animation and logic-driven animation. The former is for simple visual presentation, relying on autoplay or event triggers; the latter involves user interaction, such as character movement or combat animation.

# Slide timeline

### Overview

The sliding timeline is a specialized component that is invisible and lacks size upon creation, yet it can control the trajectories of multiple objects within it, enabling simultaneous manipulation of keyframe animations for several objects. The sliding timeline supports animation control based on the degree of sliding (e.g., speed, distance). Common use cases include free editing and animation production where playback progress is controlled by sliding.

### Use Cases

- Creating keyframe animations that can be freely edited and where the playback progress is controlled by sliding.

### Core Functions

The core function of the sliding timeline lies in its flexibility to manipulate the animation process. Sliding operations can directly impact the playback speed and direction of animations within the timeline, achieving more natural interactive effects.

### Basic Usage

1. **How to Add**

   The sliding timeline component must be added below the canvas. It requires setting the width and height properties to define the sliding range, while specific coordinates are set according to specific needs.

2. **Basic Property Settings**

   - **Auto Play**: Usually turned off to maintain the significance of sliding-controlled animation progress.
   - **Loop Play**: Used to connect the start and end of the animation.
   - **Original Duration**: Sets the basic length of the timeline.
   - **Actual Duration / Playback Speed**:
     - At a playback speed of 1, sliding to the maximum distance results in complete animation from start to finish.
     - At a playback speed of 4, sliding the same distance results in animation playback up to 1/4 of the total duration.
   - **Sliding Direction**: Default is upwards; can be adjusted according to needs.
   - **Sliding Effect / Inertial Friction**:
     - Default sliding effect is "None", synchronized with sliding.
     - Inertial friction affects the inertial deceleration effect of the animation after sliding.
   - **Sliding Effect / Jump Duration**: Combined with time markers, controls the animation playback to the next control point after sliding ends.

3. **Specific Usage**

   Materials can be added within the sliding timeline, and trajectories can be assigned to the materials that need to move. These trajectories can be edited and configured for animation effects within the timeline panel.

# timeline

## Overview

The timeline is a tool used for managing and controlling keyframe animations of multiple objects within a component. It is inherently invisible and sizeless, but by integrating the motion paths of its internal objects, it allows for simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects' animation effects.

## Use Cases

The timeline has no practical use on its own; it is typically used to add animation paths to internal objects, thus achieving unified management of multiple keyframe animations.

## Core Features

The timeline allows users to add animation paths for multiple objects within it. Users can intuitively edit these paths in the timeline panel, thereby designing and adjusting animation effects. Specific path design will be further elaborated in path-related components.

## Basic Usage

### 1. How to Add

- A timeline component can be added beneath the canvas and corresponding positioning containers.

### 2. Basic Attribute Settings

- **Auto Play**: If the timeline animation needs to play after a specific interaction, turn off auto play; otherwise, turn on auto play.
  
- **Loop Play**: If the animation needs to play continuously in a loop, turn on loop play; otherwise, turn it off.
  
- **Original Duration**: Set the original duration according to animation needs to control the length of the timeline.
  
- **Actual Duration/Playback Speed**: To adjust the overall speed of the timeline animation, you can control it by modifying the playback speed or directly setting the actual duration.

### 3. Specific Usage Steps

- Add animation assets to the timeline and assign motion paths to these assets.
- In the timeline panel, users can intuitively edit the animation effects of each path.
- In the example, the timeline includes a rectangle and an ellipse, each with their own motion paths. Refer to the detailed description of the path component for specific setup steps.

## Part Five: Precautions

- When using the timeline, ensure that the auto play and loop play settings align with animation needs to avoid affecting interactive effects.
- When adjusting playback speed or actual duration, be mindful of the overall animation rhythm to maintain visual coherence.

# Trajectory

## Overview

The trajectory component is an essential tool for adding keyframe animation and tweening to objects. By setting multiple keyframes on a timeline and defining the position and state for each keyframe, the system can automatically perform the interpolation of attributes between two keyframes. This component is not only used to define the path of an object's position change but can also control changes in other properties such as size, opacity, and rotation, thereby achieving vibrant animations.

## Use Cases

As a standardized animation component, the trajectory can be used to create a variety of animation effects, including gradient animations, free-path animations, and flash effects. It is also a crucial element in both timeline animations and sliding timeline animations.

## Core Features

1. **Keyframe Animation**: By setting the position and attributes of multiple keyframes, the system automatically generates the interpolation effects between them.
2. **Multi-Attribute Control**: Simultaneously define transformations in position, size, opacity, and rotation attributes.
3. **Time Scale Control**: The trajectory component features a time scale that can be used as an independent object or in conjunction with a timeline for controlling multiple object animations.

## Basic Usage

### Adding a Trajectory Component

Trajectory components can only be added to objects on the canvas.

### Basic Attribute Settings

1. **Autoplay**: Determine the state of the autoplay switch based on whether interaction-triggered playback is needed.
2. **Loop Playback**: Set whether the trajectory animation loops.
3. **Original Duration**: Automatically set the duration of the trajectory animation as needed.
4. **Actual Duration / Playback Speed**: Adjust playback speed or set actual duration to accelerate or decelerate animation effects.
5. **Startup Delay / Initial Hide / Generate Effects**: Control these parameters for generating trajectory effects; refer to specific usage instructions for details.
6. **Start Display / End Display**: Further set the display and hide periods of objects based on the original duration.

### Specific Use

#### Frame Animation

1. **Drag the Marker**: Freely drag the marker to the desired position within the timeline panel.
2. **Add / Delete Keyframes**: Select the marker state, then click the button above the timeline to add or delete keyframes. Avoid adding multiple keyframes at the same timestamp.
3. **Modify / Copy / Paste Keyframes**: Once a keyframe is selected, its properties can be modified. With copy and paste functions, apply the settings of one keyframe quickly to other timestamps.

#### Flash Animation

Adjust the start and end display properties in the trajectory and regulate flash effects through speed control in the timeline properties.

#### Generate Effects

Rapidly generate and apply the same keyframe effects on multiple objects, fine-tuning playback with startup delays and initial hiding settings.

### Overview

A time marker is a functional component used within a timeline or sliding timeline, primarily to assist users in setting arbitrary event trigger points or pause points in playback progress. This capability allows animations to pause at specific time points or trigger specified events by modifying specific parameters and setting exclusive events.

### Use Cases

Time markers play a crucial role in the following scenarios:
- As trigger points for quickly reaching a specific time point
- As pause points for segmented playback of animations

### Core Features

The core features of time markers include:
1. Adding time markers within a timeline/sliding timeline.
2. Modifying parameters to set specific playback trigger events.
3. Choosing to pause or continue triggering events when the animation reaches a specified time point.

### Basic Usage

1. **How to Add a Time Marker**:
   - Time markers can only be added within a timeline or sliding timeline.
   - Once added, the time marker will be displayed on the timeline panel. Users can adjust the marker position by dragging or modifying the time value.

2. **Basic Attribute Settings**:
   - **Marker Time**: Directly modifying this value sets the specific time point of the time marker.
   - **Trigger Direction**: Default is bidirectional triggering, meaning an event can be triggered at the set time point of the marker, whether playing forward or backward. Users can choose to trigger only during forward or backward playback.
   - **Pause Point**: Enabled by default. If the time marker should only trigger events without pausing the animation, this setting should be disabled.

3. **Specific Use**:
   - **Animation Breakpoint/Time Trigger Point**: By enabling the pause point, the animation will pause at the marker time during playback. Various preset actions can be triggered at the marker time.
   - **Animation Jump Point**: By enabling the pause point and setting the sliding timeline attribute to auto-jump, even if the user slides past multiple markers in a single motion, the system will automatically adjust playback to the nearest marker. The jump duration is fixed and not affected by the distance between markers.

# Object Component Technical Documentation

## Overview

Objects are various entities added under the canvas to provide their parent objects with relevant physical properties in the physical world, such as initial velocity and collision boundaries. With the physical attributes added by the object, the parent object can achieve corresponding physical motion effects automatically under the influence of the physics engine. To use objects effectively, configuration within the physical world is necessary. Components that can have objects added are typically those with visible ranges, such as rectangles, ellipses, images, videos, etc., while audio, object groups, and tracks cannot have objects added.

## Use Cases

Components that support object addition include polygons, rectangles, ellipses, counters, text, Chinese fonts, images, image sequences, videos, drawing, and QR codes. These components can add objects under the canvas's physical world to simulate common physical effects such as collisions, gravity, and friction.

## Core Features

1. **Adding Object Properties**:

   - The main function of an object is to add physical properties to its parent object, including whether the coordinates and angles are fixed, mass, horizontal/vertical velocity, angular velocity, and damping. These properties will affect the object's motion behavior in the physical world.
   
2. **Editing Collision Boundaries**:

   - The physical world predicts the motion trajectory of objects by simulating collisions. Users can edit collision boundaries to define the object's shape, affecting its collision effects. Boundaries can be defined by mouse clicking or selecting a circular collision boundary.

## Basic Usage

- **Object Property Configuration:** After adding an object, use the property panel provided by the interface for configuration. For example, you can set whether to fix the object's X and Y coordinates and rotation angle, mass properties, horizontal and vertical speed, as well as angular velocity and damping.
- **Editing Collision Boundaries:** Custom collision boundaries can be set by mouse clicking to form polygons or choosing circular boundaries.

## Advanced Usage

- **Continuous Collision Detection**: To prevent fast-moving objects from "passing through walls," continuous collision detection can be enabled. After enabling this feature, detection speed thresholds and detection frequency can be adjusted according to needs to perform denser collision detection when the object's movement speed exceeds a certain threshold. This feature provides more precise detection, but note its performance cost.

| Angular damping                | Damping of angle rotation; the larger the damping, the faster the angular speed reduction. |
| Collision reaction             | Whether to enable collision reaction, default is on. When off, the object won't collide with others. |
| Edit collision boundaries      | Draw collision boundaries of objects, default is a rectangle, can be set to circle. |
| CCD speed threshold            | Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) is effective only when the object's speed exceeds this value, default is 1000. |
| CCD frequency                  | Detection frequency; higher precision means more overhead, default is 10. |
| Continuous Collision Detection | Enables more precise collision detection to prevent fast-moving objects from penetrating. |

## Precautions

To ensure the correct collision effect, ensure the "Collision Reaction" attribute is enabled. Moreover, the XY coordinates and rotation angle of the object should not be fixed, otherwise, the object will not move even if a collision occurs.

## Further Reading

When using object components for development, developers should consider the trade-off between performance and effects. Although continuous collision detection offers more precise collision effects, it also increases computational load. It is recommended to conduct multiple tests during the functionality debugging phase to find the optimal balance between performance and effect."
# Trigger

## Overview

A trigger is a timing trigger component used to repeatedly initiate an event or animation at equal time intervals. When the intervals are short enough, the triggered events or animations appear continuous. Triggers can be configured with specific counts and intervals to cater to different triggering needs.

## Application Scenarios

Triggers are commonly used in the following scenarios:

1. **Timed, Delayed Triggers**: Triggers can facilitate delayed triggering of an action. For example, if we want an animation to replay 2 seconds after completion, a trigger can be employed to achieve this.
2. **Equal Interval Triggers**: For timed triggers at equal intervals, triggers are more convenient than a timeline. For instance, if we want a slideshow to automatically change every 3 seconds, a trigger can be used to time the intervals, triggering the slide change every 3 seconds.
3. **Continuous Triggers**: Triggers provide functionality to trigger at "every frame" intervals. A frame is the smallest unit of display refresh, varying by device, typically every 1/40th or 1/60th of a second. Setting triggers for each frame creates the illusion of continuity, allowing for certain continuous animation effects.

## Core Functions

The core functions of triggers include:

- **Fixed Interval Triggering**: Triggers can be set to activate an event or action at fixed time intervals.
- **Setting Trigger Counts**: The number of trigger activations can be configured.
- **High-Frequency Triggering**: Triggers can be configured for high-speed or high-frequency activation to meet specific scenario requirements.

## Basic Usage

### Equal Interval Triggering with Triggers

Triggers can activate at fixed time intervals, such as with a countdown component where the counter is triggered every second, decrementing by one each time. Additionally, trigger activation can be set to the current counter value, halting when it reaches zero.

### Implementing Animation Effects with Triggers

By setting triggers for continuous activation, certain animation effects can be achieved. For instance, configuring a trigger to increment an object's rotation angle upon each activation can create a seamless animation effect due to the short trigger intervals. Furthermore, triggers can be used for executing actions continuously at high refresh rates.

## Further Reading

Below are some common questions and answers regarding triggers:

### Q: How to set triggers for each frame?

A: Frame triggering is based on device display refresh rates, which vary, typically every 1/40th or 1/60th of a second. The system allows access to frame refresh rates for configuration.

### Q: How to handle trigger delays?

A: Triggers can create delays by configuring the trigger's interval and count. For example, setting a 2-second interval allows an action to be delayed by 2 seconds upon the trigger's activation.

# Cuboid

## Overview

A cuboid is a three-dimensional shape that can be texture mapped. This component represents a cuboid-shaped 3D object, but when a texture is uploaded to it, the system replicates and displays the uploaded texture on all six faces of the cuboid. Each face will stretch and fully display the uploaded texture, making it rarely used as a container for 3D panoramas.

## Use Cases

### UI Display
After uploading a texture to the cuboid, it can serve as a spherical UI display. Gesture controls can be added to determine how the cuboid moves within the 3D world under different gestures. For instance, when swiping the screen up and down, the cuboid moves along the Z-axis in the 3D world.

### Interactive Controls
Since the cuboid supports click events, it can be styled and event listeners can be added to use it as a simple interactive control.

## Basic Usage

1. **UI Display**
   - Upload a texture for UI display.
   - Add gesture controls to set how the cuboid moves within the 3D world.

2. **Interactive Controls**
   - Style the cuboid.

# Image

### Overview

The Image Component is used for inserting images into a 3D world. It has the following basic features:

- Supports image formats such as jpg, jpeg, png, gif. Using GIF native animation sources can achieve some simple animation effects.
- It has adjustable size, position, and appearance attributes.
- Image assets can come from local uploads or use online images, accessible via URL or Base 64. By redefining the "Asset Resource URL" attribute, you can replace the image asset without changing the current attributes of the image object.

### Usage Scenarios

Images, as one of the most widely used media assets, are commonly used in the following scenarios:

- As background images.
- As animation objects.
- As interactive objects.
- As decorations within a 3D world.

### Basic Usage

#### Replacing Image Assets

1. **When adding an Image Component:** The system will automatically prompt a file selector to upload an image from your local system to the VisualLogic server as the source of the image asset. You can also replace the image asset by resetting the "Asset Resource URL" attribute. This operation only changes the image asset, while dimensions, position, and other attributes remain unchanged.

   - **Images in Edit Mode**

     - Local re-upload: Click the upload icon next to "Upload Texture" to bring up the upload window, select a new image to upload. The uploaded file name will be automatically generated by the system and will not match the source file name.
       - Tips: Double-clicking the image on the stage or the image object's icon in the object tree can re-upload a local image.
     - Using online images: Simply enter the URL of the online image.
       - Tips: Images uploaded to the server are essentially online images and can be accessed directly using the URL "https://file3.ih5.cn/v35/files/" + image file name.
   - **Images in Non-Edit Mode**

     - During runtime, image asset replacement must be achieved through events.
     - Assume the resource address of the new image asset is known, or the new image is already in the current case. Set a "Set Image URL" event to reset the upload texture attribute of the image to be replaced with the target resource address.
   
2. **Using the "File Interface" Component's Upload Image Action:** Upload a new image and reset the image URL in the callback, selecting "Uploaded Image" and the attribute "URL Address".

### Core Features

- State Transformation: Change certain position and appearance attributes of the component from State 1 to State 2. The duration and animation effect type for the transition between the two states can be set.

# Sphere

## Overview

The sphere is an object in the 3D world. Apart from images and image sequences which are still 2D flat objects, other objects such as spheres, cubes, and 3D models are three-dimensional objects with a solid shape, and we can map textures onto them.

This component represents a spherical 3D object, commonly used in creating 3D panoramas as the background for a scene. We need to map the panoramic image onto the sphere's surface. For the sphere, the texture will be compressed at a 2:1 ratio before mapping onto the sphere's surface. If we want to create a panoramic sphere or a 3D globe, it is recommended to upload a 2:1 aspect ratio image for texture mapping, otherwise the image might be stretched.

## Use Cases

- **UI Display**: After uploading the texture, it can be displayed as a spherical UI. You can add gesture controls to determine how the sphere moves in the 3D world under different gestures. Example: when swiping up and down on the screen, the sphere moves along the Z-axis in the 3D world.
- **Interactive Control**: Since the sphere has click events, you can set a style for it, add event listeners, and use it as a simple interactive control.
- **Enclosed Space**: Spheres are generally used to construct a 3D panoramic enclosed space. You can upload a texture to the sphere to serve as the background of the panoramic space, place the camera inside the sphere, and add gesture controls to the camera.

## Core Features

- **Transform State**: Change some position and appearance properties of the component from state 1 to state 2. You can set the duration and type of animation effect for the state change.

## Basic Usage

1. **UI Display**
    - Upload a texture for spherical display.
    - Add gesture controls to determine how the sphere moves in the 3D world under different gestures.

2. **Interactive Control**
    - Set the style of the sphere.
    - Add event listeners to use it as a simple interactive control.

3. **Enclosed Space**
    - Upload a texture to the sphere to create a panoramic space background.
    - Place the camera inside the sphere and add gesture controls.

## Advanced Usage

- **Transform State**
    - Set the sphere's transform state functionality, transitioning from one state to another.
    - You can configure the duration and type of animation effect for the transformation.

    # Chinese Fonts

## Overview

Due to the inability to specify Chinese fonts in the browser, we provide a Chinese font component that converts input text into images in real time from the backend. As a result, Chinese fonts are essentially images rather than text. These fonts support dynamic assignment during application runtime. However, because Chinese fonts are inherently not text, their content is not rendered in real time on the frontend from data (instead, they are generated as images by the backend and returned). Therefore, their values cannot be data-bound and can only be set via assignment actions.

## Core Features

1. Dynamic Font Assignment: The Chinese font component supports dynamic font assignment at runtime through generating Chinese font images by the backend.
2. Frontend-Backend Collaboration: As Chinese fonts are essentially images, implementation requires collaboration between frontend and backend. The frontend sends content to the backend, which generates the corresponding image.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Uploading and Using Fonts:

After uploading custom font files in the "Text Font" option in the properties panel, you can view the latest uploaded font options in this font section. Select the font to use it.

### 2. Assignment

**Initial Content Setting**
In the editing state, you can input the initial text content through the "Text Content" field in the properties box.

**Dynamic Text Content Setting**
Text content can be dynamically defined through assignment actions, allowing changes to the component's text content at runtime.

## Further Reading

It is important to pay special attention to the frontend-backend interactions involved in the practical application of Chinese font components. Typically, related font image generation operations need to be completed in the application's backend, and the generated images must be transmitted to the frontend for display. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure stable and efficient frontend-backend interfaces."
# Image Sequence

### Overview

The Image Sequence component is used to manage and display a group of images arranged in a sequence. During playback, images are displayed one at a time, removed after a certain interval, and then replaced with the next (or previous) image. If the images are closely connected, using the persistence of vision, it can create an effect similar to animation or video. The Image Sequence component has the following features:

- Supports GIF or ZIP format image packages, which the system will automatically unpack into individual images;
- Allows redefining the order of images and specifying the display duration for each image;
- Multiple image sequences can be added to each image object component, but only one sequence can play at any given time, and the desired sequence to be played can be specified.

### Use Cases

The Image Sequence component can achieve smoother animation effects and is commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **Display of Image Groups**: Image sequences can automatically play a set of images for multi-image display;
- **Simulating Video or Animation Effects**: Due to the limitations of mobile devices’ video players, using video components can often degrade user experience. When video quality requirements are not very high, image sequences can replace videos, achieving smoother playback and richer interaction methods.

### Basic Usage

#### Adding an Image Sequence

You can replace image assets by resetting the "Image List" property, which only changes the image assets while maintaining their size, position, and other properties. GIFs can be directly added, and the gif’s frames will be time-controlled based on the total duration set in the attribute panel.

#### Switching Image Sequences with Swipes

You can set the swipe direction to up and disable pinch-to-zoom. Creating an upward sliding door effect can be paired with other animation effects, which is often used in interactive animations.

#### Responding to Events at Specific Frames

After adding an image sequence, it starts from the first image as frame one and increases sequentially. By listening to the "Play to Specific Frame" event, you can monitor the image sequence’s playback, which includes an event parameter—the frame index, indicating the serial number of the currently playing image. On this basis, conditional judgments can be added to execute differentiated actions when playing to different frames.

### Q&A

#### Q1: How does the image sequence component achieve animation effects?

The Image Sequence component achieves animation effects by playing a group of images sequentially, displaying only one image at a time within each period, creating an animation effect through persistence of vision. Adjusting play order and duration can also achieve effects.

#### Q2: Is looping playback possible?

Yes, the Image Sequence component supports looping playback, which can be achieved by setting the "Loop Play" property.

#### Q3: How do you trigger events at specific frames?

By listening to the "Play to Specific Frame" event. When a specific frame is played, the event carries the current frame index as a parameter. Conditional logic can be used to trigger corresponding actions."
# Geometry entity

## Overview

Similar to spheres, cuboids, and cylinders, geometric bodies are three-dimensional objects. However, geometric bodies can have irregular shapes, allowing for the presentation of various three-dimensional forms that the aforementioned objects cannot display. Texture maps need to be uploaded to modify the display content of geometric bodies.

## Core Functions

The core function of geometric bodies is to showcase irregularly shaped three-dimensional objects by importing and managing them through .obj files. This provides geometric bodies with greater flexibility and richer expressiveness compared to regular spheres, cuboids, and cylinders.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Adding Geometric Bodies

Geometric bodies, being special three-dimensional objects that can contain irregular shapes, cannot be created directly like spheres, cuboids, or cylinders. Instead, they need to be created by importing .obj files.

The specific steps are as follows:

1. Drag .obj files into the 3D world or upload them through the root component of the 3D world.
2. After uploading a 3D model, a directory structure of the model will automatically be generated under the object tree.
3. Since .obj files store an overall model typically comprised of multiple irregular geometric bodies, the uploaded geometric body is initially a colorless model. Textures need to be individually added to each geometric body to complete the object's creation.

The flowchart is as follows:

```
Start ->
Drag .obj file -> 
Upload to 3D world -> 
Generate model directory structure -> 
Apply textures to each geometric body -> 
Complete
```

### 2. UI Display

The uploaded .obj file is composed of multiple geometric bodies. Fundamentally, geometric bodies, like spheres, cuboids, or cylinders, are three-dimensional objects within the 3D world. Thus, gesture controls can also be added to control their movement within the 3D world.

# Ambient Light

#### Overview

Ambient lighting is used to add a non-directional lighting environment to all objects in a 3D world. This lighting will uniformly affect all objects, with no backlit surfaces.

#### Use Cases

Ambient lighting, due to its non-directional lighting properties, can be used to simulate lighting environments without shadows, such as outdoor light or shadowless lamps.

#### Core Features

- Provides a non-directional lighting environment
- Simulates shadowless lighting conditions

#### Basic Usage

**1. Adding Ambient Lighting**

Once ambient lighting is added to the 3D world, regardless of whether it is within a specific 3D container, it will impart lighting effects on all objects within the 3D world. For better readability in cases, it is recommended that all types of lighting be directly added to the root component of the 3D world.

After addition, you can adjust the intensity on its properties panel to change the intensity of the ambient light and set the lighting color.

**2. Adding Material to Non-lighting Type Objects**

A necessary condition for lighting to take effect is that other objects need to have material properties added. When the material of an object is "non-reflective," the object will not be affected by any lighting and will only display the original texture style.

Once a material is set for the object (the difference between glossy, matte, or metallic materials lies in the reflective effect), the object will initially appear completely black but will be illuminated due to the presence of light (the color of the illumination varies with the color of the light, in this case, blue light).

# Point Light Source

## Overview

A point light is a light source located at a specific point in the scene, emitting light in all directions with directionality. For point lights, the angle of incidence varies across the same plane of an object, resulting in more complex lighting and shadow effects. A point light is an abstract lighting condition that does not exist in reality. However, it can approximate effects for weakly illuminating objects like bulbs, fireflies, or matches.

## Basic Usage

### Adding a Point Light

Similar to ambient light, it is recommended to place the point light under the root component of the 3D world to illuminate all objects.

After adding, you can adjust the intensity on its property panel to set the ambient light's intensity and lighting color.

Since a point light emits from a specific point, we also need to adjust its position, which can be done using coordinates or central distance.

### Adding Material to Non-Illuminating Objects

Using a point light requires adding materials to objects; otherwise, the lighting will have no effect.

Note: Because a point light is emitted from a single point, varying the relative position between the light source and the object will lead to different lighting effects. Below are the lighting effects with the point light located at coordinates (0,0,500) and (500,0,0) respectively.

## Properties

| Property Name | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Range         | Sets the illumination range of the point light.              |
| Z-Axis Scale  | Sets the scaling factor of the point light along the Z-axis. |
| Decay         | Sets the decay value of the point light.                     |

# Spotlight

## Overview

A spotlight is a type of light source in a 3D environment, where the light is emitted from a single point and projects a conical light range in a specific direction. A spotlight resembles a point light source with an angular range limitation.

## Use Cases

Spotlights can be used to simulate the effects of stage lighting, car headlights, flashlights, desk lamps, etc.

## Core Features

Spotlights can be regarded as a special type of point light source, with basic usage akin to point lights. Below, we outline the features of spotlights:

### 1. Penumbra Attenuation and Emission Angle

Spotlights can incorporate penumbra attenuation effects to reduce the intensity of light at the outer edge of the spotlight;
The emission angle is a key characteristic that differentiates it from point lights, as the light emitted by spotlights is confined within a solid angle.

### 2. Object Tracking

Unlike other types of lights, spotlights can follow the movement of an object, ensuring the light continually illuminates the tracked object.

For example, if a spotlight is set to track an object like a "ball," the light will move along with the ball as it follows its trajectory.

## Properties

| Property Name   | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Distance        | Sets the illumination distance of the spotlight.       |
| Decay           | Sets the decay value of the spotlight.                 |
| Penumbra        | Sets the penumbra attenuation of the spotlight.        |
| Emission Angle  | Sets the emission angle of the spotlight.              |
| Tracking Object | Sets the object that the spotlight tracks.             |
| Z-axis Scaling  | Sets the scale factor on the Z-axis for the spotlight. |

# Window

## Overview

The window component is a tool used to display the real-time feed from a camera. When we create a new scene in a 3D world, the system automatically generates a camera. By adding a window component, we can render images of the viewport within the 3D world and observe the camera's view in real-time. The default position of the newly created window is in the top-left corner of the 3D world, with dimensions of 100x100. If there are multiple cameras in the 3D scene, you can switch the camera angle to adjust the content displayed in the window.

## Core Features

### Camera Angle Switching

Use the window component to switch the camera tied to the current window. You can specify the camera angle number to switch to, enabling dynamic content changes in the window.

### Camera Binding

Select a pre-existing camera to bind with; the window will output the image "seen" by that camera.

## Properties

# Timeline

## Overview

The timeline component is a special tool that is invisible and has no size when created. It integrates trajectories of multiple objects within it for controlling keyframe animations of multiple objects simultaneously. It is suitable for managing multi-trajectory animations. The timeline, by itself, has no significance and must have objects with trajectories added to it to realize its functionality.

## Use Cases

The timeline is suitable for scenarios where keyframe animations need to be collaboratively executed across multiple objects, and it is widely used in the process of creating complex animation effects.

## Core Features

- **Multi-Trajectory Integration**: The timeline allows simultaneous management of multiple objects' trajectories to achieve synchronized animation effects.
- **Keyframe Animation Management**: The trajectories contained within the timeline can facilitate editing and controlling keyframe animations.

## Basic Usage

### Adding the Timeline

The timeline component can be added beneath the canvas and relatively positioned containers.

### Basic Attribute Settings

1. **Auto-Play**:
   - If the animation needs to play only after certain interactions, disable the auto-play switch; otherwise, enable it.
2. **Loop Play**:
   - If the animation needs to loop continuously, turn on the loop play switch; otherwise, turn it off.
3. **Original Duration**:
   - Automatically set the original duration to control the length of the timeline according to animation needs.
4. **Actual Duration/Play Speed**:
   - To accelerate or decelerate the edited timeline animation as a whole, control the actual animation length by adjusting the play speed or directly setting the actual duration.

### Specific Usage Steps

1. Add materials within the timeline and add trajectories to the materials that require movement.
2. In the timeline panel, intuitively edit the corresponding trajectories to set their animation effects. For detailed operations on trajectories, refer to the trajectory component section.

### Example

After adding rectangles and ellipses under the timeline, trajectories can be added to both. For specific trajectory settings, please refer to the trajectory component introduction.

## Attributes

| Attribute Name    | Attribute Description                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-Play         | Controls whether the animation starts automatically |
| Loop Play         | Controls whether the animation loops                |
| Original Duration | Controls the original length of the timeline        |
| Actual Duration   | Controls the actual play time of the animation      |
| Play Speed        | Controls the play speed of the animation            |

# service

## Overview

The service is an important component for achieving data interaction between VisualLogic front-end applications and the backend database. Its working principle can be likened to the interaction between customers, waiters, and the kitchen in a restaurant: the front-end application (customers) communicates with the backend database (kitchen) through service requests (waiters), passing the operations to be executed (ordering), and returning the processing results in the form of parameters (serving). This design not only ensures the security and state monitoring of front-end and back-end data interactions but also achieves logic reuse through reasonable service design, improving the maintainability of the project.

The service provides a more efficient and secure data communication mode compared with traditional independent events, and it can realize cross-application data interaction capability through converting to standard Restful APIs, making it an effective means of data sharing between applications.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Customer
    participant Service as Service (Waiter)
    participant Backend as Backend (Kitchen)

    Client->>Service: Order: Steak Set 1, medium rare
    Service->>Backend: Send request
    Backend->>Backend: Process request
    Backend->>Service: Processing completed
    Service->>Client: Result delivered: Steak, Soda, Salad
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Simple Service Request Example

In practical applications, such as a user wants to enter their name in the front-end and query their age, finally showing the age result in the front-end. In this scenario, you can create receiving parameters (such as “receive name”) and return parameters (such as “return age”), write the database query logic into the service, get the “name” from the input box when the service is called, and set the “age” as a return parameter after the query is successful.

## Core Functions

### Service Multiple Returns and Interruptions

The service can set multiple return results within it, if no special measures are taken, the result set last will be effective. If you wish to abort the service upon executing a certain condition, you can use the method “set return result and abort service”, so the service will immediately abort and no further return result settings will be made.

### Service Sharing and Publishing

By publishing the service as an API, an effective data sharing method, the service can be used inside and outside of VisualLogic applications. Public services are called through specific URLs, especially when called across accounts or in non-VisualLogic applications, increasing the flexibility of data interaction between applications. At the same time, the microservice function for internal enterprise use supports sharing services among different applications without the need to set background logic repeatedly.

### Service Logging

The VisualLogic service component supports logging functions, to record the detailed process of service calls, including parameter and response information. This function can help developers better monitor the service running state and troubleshoot potential issues.

## Basic Usage

The service is mainly used in the backend and is usually added in the backend directory. When calling a service, the most common operation is to set receiving parameters and return parameters. By adding receiving parameters, the service can obtain data transmitted from the front end; by setting return parameters, the backend processing results can be returned to the front end for callback use.

- **Step 1**: Add input boxes and buttons in the front end, and add a database and service in the backend.
- **Step 2**: Edit the data table to support the required fields.
- **Step 3**: Set the required receiving and return parameters in the service component and define the processing logic.
- **Step 4**: Define the event that triggers the service, such as button click.

## Advanced Usage

Asynchronous service calls are one of the methods to improve service processing capabilities, especially suitable for scenarios where a large amount of data or long-time computation needs to be processed. Through message queues, service calls can quickly return responses without affecting front-end smoothness.

## Attributes

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Receiving Parameter | Specifies input parameters that the service can receive, usually passed from the front end. |
| Return Parameter    | Specifies the output data returned by the service to the front end, used to present processing results. |

## Actions

| Action Name                         | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start Service                       | Used when a service request needs to be initiated from the front end. |
| Call Service                        | Used in the backend request service context.                 |
| Set Custom Return Result            | Defines the return details of the service, including content type and messages. |
| Set Return Result                   | Used to set return parameters after the callback.            |
| Set Return Result and Abort Service | Pre-terminates the service operation and returns the result, suitable for scenarios where the service needs to be interrupted. |
| Asynchronous Call Service           | Uses the MQ function to asynchronously handle service calls, suitable for high-concurrency scenarios. |

## Events

| Event Name    | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Service Start | An event triggered when the service starts, actions can be bound to its execution. |

## Extraction Precautions

- After setting as a public service, the service parameters are no longer encrypted, so please pay attention to data security.
- When converting a service to an API, please debug and test the correctness of the interface URL for different occasions.
- Service state changes need to be published or previewed again to ensure the public service is effective.

## Extended Reading

When connecting to enterprise applications, using enterprise private services or microservices can effectively improve data security and independence. Enterprise users should consider the reasonable division of API interfaces when designing services, which can not only improve the flexibility of applications but also better control the security risks of service calls."
# Timer Service

## Overview

The Timer Service component is similar to service components as they can both operate databases and modify related backend data. However, the start of the Timer Service is triggered based on a preset time, rather than being triggered by a frontend component. This makes it especially suitable for scenarios where backend operations need to be automatically executed within a specific time period.

## Use Cases

1. Automatically execute operations in the backend at a specific time period.
2. Determine whether certain activities occur within the scheduled start and end times. This type of determination is usually controlled by the backend rather than a simple local time judgment, because users can change the local time to bypass the time limit.

## Core Functions

The Timer Service mainly provides the following functions:

- **Start Time**: Set the time to execute the service (should be set after the application is published).
- **Repeat Interval**: Set the time interval for repeated execution (in seconds), with a minimum of 60 seconds.
- **Repeat Count**: Define the number of times the service is triggered repeatedly. In the preview environment, it can be executed up to 100 times. In the published environment, the number of executions is not limited.
- **Initial Disable**: Decide when the service properties take effect. If enabled, it needs to be activated by event actions; if disabled, the save or publish operation will automatically take effect.
- **Parallel Threads**: The number of concurrent threads, used to batch process large tasks, can be set to a maximum of 100.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Setting the Property Panel

- **Start Time**: Define when to start the service.
- **Repeat Interval**: Set the time interval for the service to be repeatedly executed.
- **Repeat Count**: Determine the number of executions of the service.
- **Initial Disable**: Control when the service properties take effect.
- **Parallel Threads**: Configure the number of service instances running simultaneously to reduce execution time when processing large amounts of data.

### 2. Event Actions

You can dynamically control the Timer Service through the following event actions:

- **Record Return Results**: Process and record the return results of the service.
- **Get Current Configuration**: Get the currently effective service configuration parameters, such as start time, end time, etc.
- **Reset Timer Service**: Reconfigure service parameters to restart and update the service.
- **Delete Timer Service**: Stop and delete the service instance, terminating its execution.

These functions support the creation of a control case that allows viewing, modifying, starting, or stopping the Timer Service without opening the editor.

## Notes

- Once the Timer Service configuration takes effect, it will automatically start running in the backend and execute at the set time, even if the application is not open.
- When setting up, make sure the start time is after the application is published to prevent unexpected triggering.

Through the above configurations and usage methods, you can efficiently automate backend operations within specific time periods, enhancing the level of application automation."
# Transaction

## Overview

### Feature Overview

A transaction is a set of database operations that can combine multiple database operations into one unit. The key to transactions is ensuring data operation consistency. If any step fails, the system will roll back the entire operation sequence. This greatly enhances the reliability of data operations, especially in high concurrency and high data consistency scenarios. For example, in a complex transaction, we can define the following operation flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A((Transaction Start)) --> B[Data Phase 1 Commit]
    B -->|Success| C[Data Phase 2 Update]
    C -->|Success| D[Data Phase 3 Update]
    D -->|Success| E((Transaction Success))
  
    B --> |Rollback on Failure| A
    C --> |Rollback on Failure| A
    D --> |Rollback on Failure| A
```

As illustrated above, the transaction is considered successful only if all steps are executed successfully. Once any step fails, the transaction will roll back to the initial state, restoring the protected database data to its pre-change state.

### Transaction Creation and Invocation

The process of creating and invoking a transaction is similar to setting up a backend action group. After creation, we can define its logic in the transaction's event panel:

- The transaction contains 2 input parameters to accept data passed in during invocation.
- It includes 2 output parameters returning the success and failure status of the processing result.

It is worth noting that transactions are purely backend operations and cannot be called directly on the frontend; they must be implemented through services.

### Transaction Rollback

In VisualLogic, there are two types of transaction rollbacks: automatic and manual rollback.

1. **Automatic Rollback**: The system automatically rolls back when it detects a database operation failure (e.g., commit failure, update failure). These errors are usually systemic issues, such as a database connection failure or data exceeding limits. An automatic rollback is triggered whenever any database operation fails.
   
2. **Manual Rollback**: Manual rollback is used to cover scenarios that automatic rollback cannot satisfy. For example, an update must affect more than 0 rows to continue the operation. If the update affects 0 rows, the system might consider the update a success, but it actually needs a rollback. In this case, manual rollback is executed, and error information is set to return.

### Internal Working Principles and Computational Costs

1. **Removing the Read-Write Separation Mechanism**: All operations performed in a transaction are executed on the write instance, so read and write operations are immediately synchronized within a transaction. This mechanism avoids data delays but increases computational costs.

2. **Data Locking**: When a row of data is updated in a transaction, the database locks that row to prevent data inconsistencies. The transaction processing mode is sequential and will unlock only after completion. This ensures data consistency but reduces transaction processing speed.

## Use Cases

- **High Data Consistency Requirements**: In finance, inventory management, and other fields, transactions are key tools for ensuring data consistency.
- **High Concurrency Operations**: Effectively handle inconsistencies resulting from concurrent operations.
- **Complex Database Operations**: Simplify the operation process when multiple steps need to be uniformly successful.

## Core Features

- **Transactions**: As the unit of database operations, it guarantees the atomicity of a series of operations.
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Ensures that any failure can be reversed, protecting data integrity.

## Basic Usage

1. **Transaction Creation**: Define transactions in VisualLogic through the event panel.
2. **Parameter Settings**: Input parameters are used to receive data during invocation, and output parameters return the results.
3. **Transaction Invocation**: Called via services instead of the frontend.
4. **Rollback Configuration**: Two rollback modes, automatic and manual, based on system automatic judgment or manual configuration.

## Properties

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Transaction Start | Starts the execution of actions within the transaction and can invoke the transaction's input parameters. |

## Notes

- Transaction processing time is limited (5 seconds). Ensure the transaction logic is concise to avoid timeout situations, preventing the triggering of the failure message "Context deadline exceeded.""
# Microservices

## Overview

Microservice is an architectural pattern that supports calling services between different applications. It allows services defined in one application to be reused by other applications, avoiding the need to repeatedly build the same service. Compared to public services, microservices have significant advantages in security and efficiency, ensuring data security through encrypted requests and improving service call efficiency via intranet paths. Additionally, microservices include documentation features, allowing developers to view and debug service parameters at any time, thereby increasing development efficiency.

## Use Cases

Microservices are suitable for scenarios that require cross-application service calls and play an optimization role in complex application architectures. Typical use cases include front-end and back-end separation in distributed systems, multi-developer team collaboration, etc. By splitting an application system into multiple independent service modules, complexity is reduced, and the flexibility of release and maintenance is improved.

## Core Features

- **Service Security**: Encryption of microservice request paths to improve security.
- **Efficient Invocation**: Service call efficiency is improved through intranet paths.
- **Real-time Document Update**: Real-time updates of service parameter documents to increase development efficiency.
- **Cross-application Service Reuse**: Supports the reuse of services between multiple applications.
- **Application Splitting and Optimization**: By splitting applications, the complexity of each module is reduced.

## Basic Usage

### Creating Microservices

1. After defining the service in the application, enable the "Microservice" option.
2. Set the service name and description.
3. Once the service is successfully created, it will be displayed in the backend resource panel for easy viewing and management.

### Using Microservices

1. In the backend resource panel, find the required microservice.
2. Click to view details such as service name, description, and parameter information.
3. Click Add to add the microservice to the application's backend root node.
4. Call the microservice methods from the front end or the backend, similar to calling ordinary services.

```mermaid

    A[Enable Microservice] --> B[Set Name and Description]
    B --> C[Display in Backend Resource Panel]
    C --> D[Find Microservice]
    D --> E[View Details]
    E --> F[Add to Backend]
    F --> G[Invoke Microservice]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Publishing Microservices and Multi-developer Development

- When one application calls microservices from another application, ensure that the called application has been published.
- In a multi-developer environment, ensure that the microservice provider application is pushed to the main branch to guarantee that the called service is the latest version.

## Properties

| Property Name      | Description                                                  |

## Further Reading

For more information on microservices, refer to the following FAQs:

- **What existing backend dependencies does VisualLogic have?**
  VisualLogic automatically binds the required dependency packages based on the features and components used by the user. When using microservices (Dubbo framework), the Nacos microservice registration center plugin is required.

With the above content, you can effectively build and manage a microservice system, enhancing the synergy between applications and the overall robustness of the system."
# Dy Transactions

## Overview

Dy Transaction is a feature used to package writable operations on multiple tables into a single unit, ensuring that multiple steps either succeed or fail simultaneously. Its use cases are similar to ordinary transaction components (like MySQL transactions), but it is not as flexible as MySQL transactions. The purpose of Dy Transaction is to enhance response capability under high concurrency by reducing the consumption of connection numbers through fewer requests. This is the primary reason for using Dy Transaction instead of MySQL transactions in certain operations.

## Use Cases

Dy Transaction is suitable for scenarios where multiple steps need to be performed on tables without requiring complex transaction logic. For example, a large amount of voting or lottery logic. In these cases, Dy Transaction can respond and execute quickly.

However, in situations where complex transaction definitions are required, such as calling external APIs within a transaction (e.g., payment scenarios), traditional MySQL transactions must be used. MySQL transactions allow precise definition of the data operation process.

## Core Features

1. **Operation Packaging**: Up to 25 writable operations on tables can be packaged together.
2. **Transactional Unit**: Ensures that all operations either succeed or fail entirely.
3. **Efficient Concurrent Processing**: Compared to MySQL transactions, Dy Transaction reduces connection consumption and improves response speed for high concurrent requests.

## Basic Usage

### Creating a Dy Transaction
- Similar to an action group, once created, the event panel will display directly.
- In the event panel, you can define the operations to be packaged. The operations can only target tables but can involve multiple table components.

### Operation Types
- Commit, Update, Delete Data: Basic writable operations on the table.
- Validate Data: Used to verify if data under a table meets certain conditions.

#### Points to Note for Data Validation
- The data being validated cannot be the target data for other write operations within the Dy Transaction.
- If you need to validate the value of written data, use the "precondition" of the update or delete operations.

### Invocation
- After defining the Dy Transaction, it can be called directly in the service.
- Note: Dy Transaction can only return a success or failure status, and cannot return other parameters.

## Properties

| Property Name     | Description             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Accept Parameters | No detailed description |

## Actions

| Action Name         | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Execute Transaction | Whether it succeeds, reason for failure |

## Events

| Event Name        | Description             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Transaction Start | No detailed description |

## Implementation Notes

- In Dy transactions, the target object can only be tables, and you cannot insert other non-table operations.
- It is not possible to manually define or set rollback logic; the result is either success or failure.

## Additional Reading

Dy Transaction is a popular choice for users aiming to achieve transaction packaging with low complexity. Additionally, MySQL transactions, prepared for more complex needs, provide more flexible and precise control. Choosing the right transaction management method according to project requirements is crucial."
# API

## Overview

API components serve as the unified entry point for initiating HTTP network requests in VisualLogic. They are divided into front-end and back-end APIs. Although the use scenarios for these two components are slightly different, their basic logic is consistent. In this document, we will introduce both types of APIs together. The front-end API initiates network requests on the browser side. In small programs, native applications, or Windows/Mac applications, the VisualLogic system will automatically connect to the native layer’s interface to implement network request functionality. The back-end API initiates network requests on the server side, which needs to be called and the results processed in the back-end service.

## Use Cases

The front-end API is suitable for scenarios where all request logic is completed on the client side. It is simple to operate and saves server resources. For APIs with high security requirements, using the back-end API can provide better security. Additionally, to handle API requests with cross-domain restrictions, requests need to be made in the back-end.

## Core Functions

### API Usage Process

1. **Initiate Call**: On the front-end, the request can be triggered through UI components, such as pressing a button; on the back-end, it can be triggered through services or timers.
2. **Server Request**: The API component sends a request to the third-party server.
3. **Server Response**: Returns results for the next logic processing step.
4. **Logic Processing**: Completed by the client on the front end and by the service on the back end.

For example, in a simple front-end API usage scenario, when the user clicks a button, an API call is triggered, the API component automatically initiates the request, and processes the returned results.

### Configuration and Debugging

Before using the API, basic configuration and real-time debugging need to be done in the properties panel. Configuration includes request address, request method, and request parameters. You can debug the API using the debug button and use the “Retain Result Structure” feature to parse the return value as a JSON structure.

### API Call

Configure the request parameters in the event panel and reference the return result for logical processing. For example, specifying the request address, timeout duration, Header and Body parameters, obtaining the return result, and displaying or further processing it.

## Basic Usage

- **Request Parameter Specification**: Includes request address, request method, and request parameters (Header and Body parameters). Can be dynamically specified to bind variables.
- **Getting Return Results**: Reference the API return value through callback blocks, including failure reasons, request duration, and other information.
  
## Advanced Usage

### Proxy Requests and Stream Processing

Use the “Prepare Proxy Request” action of the back-end API component to initiate API requests and obtain sessions. You can handle streaming returned data and add it to chat data through action groups after processing the data stream.

## Properties

| Property Name                    | Description                                                  |

| Call Method                      | Set the operation and data transfer method of the HTTP protocol. |
| Body Type                        | Define the format type of the request parameters, default is JSON. |
| Timeout Duration                 | Set the connection timeout limit for the request, in seconds. |
| Header Parameters                | Add Header parameters to the API.                            |
| Body Parameters                  | Set Body parameters for the API.                             |
| Debug                            | Click to display the API debug results in the debug result content bar. |
| Disable Certificate Verification | Define whether to allow API requests without verification.   |
| Custom Certificate               | Specify a custom certificate, usually used for advanced payment-related APIs. |
| Certificate Key                  | The key of the custom certificate.                           |
| Return Result Format Conversion  | Automatic conversion of return result format.                |
| Ignore Front-End Header          | Ignore the Header information sent by the user on the front end while calling the service, to avoid cross-domain issues. |
| Return Response Header           | Whether the Header information returned by the API is needed. |

## Actions

| Action Name           | Description                                                  |

# Encryption

## Overview

Encryption involves the process of modifying original information through specific algorithms, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot directly interpret the content even if they obtain the ciphertext. Through the encryption component, plaintext can be encrypted, or ciphertext can be decrypted. This bidirectional conversion ensures the security of data during transmission, particularly in front-end and back-end communication, preventing data from being intercepted and leaked by third parties.

Based on different encryption and decryption mechanisms, encryption mainly falls into three types:

- **Symmetric encryption**: Uses a single-key cryptosystem, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric encryption**: Involves a pair of public and private keys, where data encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
- **Irreversible encryption**: Once encrypted, data cannot be decrypted. The correctness is verified by re-entering the plaintext and processing it with the same algorithm.

## Use Cases

Encryption is widely used in scenarios such as data transmission and user authentication to ensure data security and privacy protection. For example, in online payment systems, users' bank card information is encrypted on the client side and then transmitted to the server over the network, ensuring the information is not stolen.

## Core Functions

1. **Symmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Requires the same key and initialization vector for both encryption and decryption. Common algorithms include AES, DES, and 3DES.
2. **Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Only the RSA algorithm is used, with the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption.
3. **Irreversible Encryption**: There is no decryption process, and correctness can only be verified by re-encrypting and matching the result.
4. **Password Management**: Provides methods for generating and verifying passwords, ensuring user security when entering passwords.

## Basic Usage

### Symmetric Encryption

1. Select a specific encryption algorithm (such as AES, DES).
2. Ensure the key and initialization vector length meet the algorithm requirements.
3. Call the encryption or decryption function, passing in the necessary parameters.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Select Algorithm] --> B(Encrypt)
A --> C(Decrypt)
B --> D[Result Processing]
C --> D
```

### Asymmetric Encryption

1. Use the RSA algorithm.
2. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Input Plain Text/Public Key] --> B(Encrypt)
B --> C[Encrypted Data]
C --> D[Decrypt]
D --> E[Plain Text Output]
```

### Irreversible Encryption

1. Directly input plaintext and call the encryption function.
2. If the HMAC algorithm is enabled, a key must be provided.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Input Plain Text] --> B(Encrypt)
B --> C[Encryption Result]
B --> D[Verification]
D --> E[Verification Result]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Generate and Verify Passwords

The password generation function can convert a user-provided plaintext password (such as "abc123") into a complex encrypted string. The generated password is stored in a database to ensure the security of user information. Additionally, the password verification function can check the consistency of the user-entered password and the password stored in the database.

QuickTable is ideal for high-concurrency data storage and processing scenarios, such as user behavior logs, order information, and IoT device data. Its flexible storage structure and efficient query capabilities allow QuickTable to handle the needs of simultaneous massive data writes and reads.

## Core Features

### Data Model

QuickTable's data model can be classified as "column-storage" type, supporting diverse data storage and access. Each record is defined by a unique combination of Partition Key and Sort Key, determining the data's storage location and sorting order. This design not only enhances the speed of single data access but also optimizes data distribution efficiency.

### Creating Tables

When creating a QuickTable, the system automatically generates four default fields: Partition Key, Sort Key, creation time, and expiration time. When adding custom fields to a table, six field types are supported: text, number, array, object, text set, and number set.

### Custom Indexes

In addition to default indexes, users can add text and numeric indexes as needed to help improve the efficiency of specific queries.

## Basic Usage

### Data Submission

QuickTable supports various data submission modes, including "submit a single data" and "submit or overwrite a single data." Each piece of submitted data must specify a clear data ID, with these two submission methods differing in the handling of duplicate data IDs.

### Data Queries

QuickTable provides three query methods:

1. **Get Single Data**: Retrieve a single data entry by specifying the data ID.
2. **Get Multiple Data**: Retrieve multiple data entries by specifying multiple data IDs.
3. **Get Data Within Range**: Retrieve data within a specified range by indicating the Partition Key and index fields.

### Data Updates

QuickTable supports single and batch data updates. Single updates allow conditional and functional operations on a specific field, while batch updates are suitable for overall data replacement.

### Data Deletion

Single and batch data deletions are also supported. Single deletions can incorporate user-defined preconditions.

## Advanced Usage

### Transactions and Unit Operations

Although QuickTable does not feature a full SQL-like transactional control mechanism, it provides a simple transaction function, allowing multiple write operations to be processed together. A transaction can consist of up to 25 operational units, ensuring that all operations either succeed or fail together.

# dbo

### Overview

**dbo** is a tool component in VisualLogic used for connecting to custom databases. Through the dbo component, users can connect to any self-deployed MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Postgres databases. Users can write SQL statements in VisualLogic to manipulate databases and integrate the results with other functional logic. The dbo component does not manage the database itself; it only provides a method to connect to external databases, making it significantly different from using a regular database.

### Use Cases

dbo is suitable for scenarios where there is a need to connect and operate custom-deployed databases. Users can leverage the service logic built in VisualLogic to write and execute custom SQL to perform various database operations. This component supports connections to MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Postgres databases.

### Core Features

- **Connect to Custom Databases**: By setting up database connection configurations, including database type, connection address, username, password, etc., users can flexibly connect to external databases in VisualLogic.
- **SQL Operation Security**: To avoid security risks such as SQL injection, all SQL operations must be executed through predefined SQL templates. Dynamic SQL writing in services is prohibited.

### Basic Usage

1. **Set Connection Configuration**: Users need to set the database connection parameters, including `dbType`, `linkUrl`, `username`, `password`, and `dsn`. These properties can be set using the connection configuration methods of dbo.
2. **Write SQL Templates**: Under the settings of dbo, users can define SQL execution logic within SQL templates. Specific SQL statements need to be passed in as strings, and using SQL templates is recommended to enhance security.

Through the above features and usage methods, users can proficiently apply the dbo component in VisualLogic to perform database operations, achieving customized database management solutions."
# Video

### Overview

In the field of video processing, two important concepts regarding video files are **coding format** and **container format**. Coding format refers to the compression algorithms for video and audio, while container format is the specific format that packages the compressed data into a video file. Common video codecs include MPEG-1/-2, WMV, RMVB, Xvid, AVC/H.264, etc., and popular audio codecs include Mp3, AC-3, AAC, etc. Supported container formats are diverse, such as AVI, MP4, MKV, etc.

Video files can be divided into local playback videos and streaming media videos suitable for online playback. Although some file formats like MP4 are widely supported across multiple devices and environments, the different codecs used in videos may cause compatibility issues even for files with the same format. Additionally, different browsers have varied support for video file formats, making it essential to select appropriate formats to ensure compatibility.

### Use Cases

Using video as an expressive form enables various implementations such as embedded videos, full-screen videos, and interactive videos, suitable for various applications like video-on-demand and online education. To ensure video compatibility, it may be necessary to transcode to H.264 format MP4, especially for larger or longer video materials where segmentation is recommended.

### Core Functionality

#### Basic Usage

1. **Video Transcoding**: For non-H.264 format videos, it is recommended to pre-transcode to ensure compatibility.
2. **Replace Video Material**: Video material can be changed by modifying the resource URL without affecting its appearance and playback properties.
3. **Video Control**: Playback can be directly controlled via video control buttons or through event-based actions.

#### Video Storage and Sharing

- Videos are accessed via resource URLs. Videos can be replaced by re-uploading or using a different network URL.
- Control bar display is supported, allowing users to directly control playback progress.

## Code Implementation Considerations

All the functionalities mentioned in this technical document can be implemented using VisualLogic tools. Ensure that the project is correctly configured with VisualLogic before using the related methods to invoke the required native functionalities."
# Windows application

## Overview

The Windows application component is used to configure the settings related to Windows application packaging. VisualLogic provides the functionality to package any web application into a Windows application using the Electron packaging tool. Once packaged, the front-end application can be directly bundled into a Windows exe and run on a Windows system.

Note, the Windows application packaging functionality merely packages the front-end part of the example, much like exporting HTML. Therefore, if you need to use backend-related functionalities, such as connections (WebSocket), databases, etc., a full-stack private deployment export is required.

## Use Cases

- Convert a web application to run as a Windows application.
- Provide the ability to upload local files after the application is packaged.
- Customize the window display state of the application (e.g., fullscreen, maximize, minimize).

## Core Features

1. Package any web application into a Windows application.
2. Provide options for initial fullscreen and hiding the menu bar.
3. Support manually specifying the port number to ensure port number consistency.
4. Support local file upload capabilities, creating a local folder under the application's root directory for file storage.

## Basic Usage

### Menu Bar and Fullscreen Settings

Through the menu bar and initial fullscreen properties of the Windows application, you can set whether to hide the menu bar and whether to start in fullscreen mode when packaging. Initial fullscreen means the exe will automatically start in fullscreen. If initial fullscreen is not selected, the application can later be fullscreened using F11 once running.

### Port Number

When VisualLogic packages a Windows application, it comes with a web server. If no port number is specified, the system will automatically generate one. Typically, this won't cause issues, but in cases of port conflicts or the need for a fixed port number for external services, you can manually specify a port number.

### Upload Files to Local Directory

The feature to upload files to the local directory provides a convenient file server. If this option is enabled, the packaged Windows application will create a new folder in the same directory as the application at runtime. The folder name defaults to "ivxFiles" but can be manually specified.

At this time, all images and files uploaded via the file interface component and images and videos uploaded via the rich text editor will be saved in this local folder. This way, the purely front-end Windows exe can provide some backend functionalities.

Using this feature, we can also save some locally generated data. For instance, through the "upload text to file" functionality of the file interface, part of the data generated by the application (such as content edited in the rich text editor) can be saved as a text file and uploaded to the local folder.

By repeatedly calling this interface, you can update the content in the rich text editor. After the content is saved, the previously saved content can be retrieved via a GET request to the corresponding text content through the API component.

In the following demo, we implemented saving the content of the rich text editor to the local folder and reading the previously saved content. (Note, this can only be experienced after packaging for Windows):

  # Form Fields

# Form Fields

## Overview

In VisualLogic, form fields are one of the core components used for building form-based applications, typically used in conjunction with form containers. By configuring various field properties, developers can implement multiple data input and validation features to meet the needs of various application scenarios. For detailed usage, refer to the relevant form container documentation.

## Properties

The form field component comes with a rich set of property configurations. Below is a detailed description of each property:

| Property Name     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Field Name        | The name of the current field, used as the key in the object when getting and setting form data. |
| Field Value Type  | The data type bound to the field, supporting built-in data types such as text, number, phone number, email, etc., or custom types set through regular expressions. |
| Custom Regex      | When the field value type is set to custom, a regular expression can be defined here. |
| Default Value     | If the user does not specify the current field value, the system will use this default value. |
| Bound Attribute   | Usually a user input-related attribute, such as the content of an input box or the selected value of a dropdown menu. |
| Required          | Specifies whether the field is a required item; by default, it is not. If set to true, the field cannot be empty, otherwise, validation will fail. |
| Binding Direction | The direction of the field's binding to the component attribute, supporting two-way binding, one-way get, one-way set, and disable. |

## Events

During the operation of form fields, the following events may be triggered:

| Event Name         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Validation Success | When the form container retrieves data, it automatically validates whether all fields under the form container are legal. If the field value is legal, this event is triggered. |
| Validation Failure | When the form container retrieves data, it automatically validates whether all fields under the form container are legal. If the field value is illegal, this event is triggered. |

## Precautions

When using the form field component, be sure to consider the validity of the field values. If a field is set as required, ensure that the user has entered a valid value. Also, choose the binding direction appropriately to avoid data synchronization issues.

## Further Reading

To gain a deeper understanding of the application of form fields, refer to the form container section in the relevant VisualLogic documentation to learn how to implement data input and validation more efficiently. Additionally, you can try using custom regular expressions to meet specific scenario input specifications."
# Skeletal Component

## Overview

Skeleton components are automatically generated components of a model after importing skeletal animations. These skeletons are encapsulated within an object known as the "Skeleton Container," defined within the initial skeletal animation model and thus cannot be added in the editor. They are akin to model parts under obj/gltf models in a 3D world. Skeleton component provides additional control functionalities to the original skeletal animation model, especially the capability of dynamically controlling specific bones, including:

1. Dynamically changing the texture of skeleton components through the "Custom Texture" attribute;
2. Overlaying transformations such as translation and rotation on the current state of the bone through the "Transform Bone State" action.

## Use Cases

The "Transform Bone State" action is suitable for scenarios requiring dynamic control of individual bone effects. For example, in a game, a character's gun muzzle needs to move along with finger movements. This action allows any property change on specific bones for flexible control, especially in games requiring complex interaction, not limited to playing fixed animations.

## Core Features

### Transform Bone State

This feature allows setting overlay transformations for a skeleton component, including rotation angle, scaling, translation, and skew. Note that these transformations are added on top of the original model, rather than being independent transformations.

## Basic Usage

### Basic Usage of Transform Bone State

Directly assign corresponding values to properties.

- `rotation`: Controls the rotation angle of the bone.
- `scaleX`: Controls scaling in the X-axis direction.
- `scaleY`: Controls scaling in the Y-axis direction.
- `skew`: Controls the skew angle.
- `x`: Controls offset in the x-direction.
- `y`: Controls offset in the y-direction.

Ensure that the skeletal animation includes properties to be overlaid and that related animations are set to auto-loop playback.

## Advanced Usage

### IK Control

IK (Inverse Kinematics) utilizes the end joint to drive movement within the skeleton chain, producing more natural animation effects.

Steps:

1. Select two connected bones in DragonBones, typically starting control from the wrist to the arm.
2. Generate a constraint target for the end bone in the panel.
3. Add a control target corresponding to the empty bone in VisualLogic to implement IK control.

Ensure the bones being controlled have relevant animations and export as a zip file for import into VisualLogic.

## Properties

| Property Name    | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built-in Texture | The texture provided with the model                          |
| Custom Texture   | Upload custom textures to override the model's built-in texture |

| # Page Container     |                                                              |

## Overview

The Page Container is a specialized page component designed to achieve a sliding page-flip effect, commonly used for creating traditional H5 sliding pages or page carousel effects. Unlike ordinary pages, it follows finger sliding instead of simple trigger-based flipping. The Page Container supports preloading pages to enhance the browsing experience, currently limited to web environments and not supported in mini-program environments.

The Page Container can contain multiple sub-pages (page-flips), which operate similarly to ordinary pages and can include any web components. Sub-pages can be set statically or generated dynamically using "for" and "if" components.

## Use Cases

- **Traditional H5 Sliding Pages**: Suitable for scenarios requiring multi-page, multi-content displays.
- **Page Carousel**: Used for projects with diversified, multi-content carousel needs.

## Core Features

### Page Flip Behavior Settings

1. **Flip Direction**: The default is left-right page flip, but can be set to up-down flip.
2. **Flip Effects**: Six transition effects are available, including slide, fade, 3D cube, flip, card flow, and card.
3. **Page Gap**: Can be set in slide and card modes, default is 100.
4. **Slide Sensitivity**: Affects the page movement distance when sliding with a finger, default is 1; the higher the setting, the farther the movement.

### Preloading of Flip Pages

The number of preloaded pages is set as needed. You can set to preload the current page and several pages thereafter to ensure seamless page transitions. Usually, preloading 1-3 pages is recommended. Note that preloading behavior only starts when the Page Container component is rendered.

### Animations and Timelines in Flip Pages

For effects or timeline animations that need to be automatically triggered when the page is displayed, manual invocation is required to play, and special attention is needed to automatically trigger effects during the pre-rendering phase.

## Extended Reading

When using the Page Container, to ensure a smooth sliding experience, it is recommended to reasonably preload multimedia elements for each page and appropriately design manual triggering mechanisms to control the timing of animations and timelines. Additionally, avoid complex styles and interactions to reduce potential performance overhead."
# Cache

## Overview

Cache database is specially designed to improve data query speed and reduce database burden, used to store commonly queried data. This type of database mainly contains popular data that is infrequently updated but frequently read. By integrating storage, it speeds up data access. For results that require complex computations, they can also be pre-stored in the cache database to improve service response efficiency.

## Underlying Implementation

VisualLogic's cache database interface is designed based on the Redis interface. In private deployments, Redis is used, while in public cloud environments, since Redis cannot elastically scale, AWS's DynamoDB is used to simulate the Redis interface. DynamoDB is a serverless fast access database that can match the performance of Redis, has no throughput bottlenecks, and in the public cloud, the cost is combined with that of QuickTable.

## Use Cases

In the data query and update process, the cache plays an important role:

- **Data Query**: First, check if the requested data already exists in the cache. If it does, return it directly; otherwise, query the original database and store the result in the cache.
- **Data Update**: To ensure the accuracy and "freshness" of cache data, synchronize updating or deleting the cache when the original data changes.

## Basic Usage

The cache primarily involves two aspects of usage: data query and data update. During this process, it is crucial to ensure query speed and the accuracy of cached data.

1. **Data Query**: By checking the cache database, if the requested data is in the cache, it is returned directly, saving query time; if not found, it is obtained from the original database and the cache is updated.
2. **Data Update**: When the original data changes, the cache must be updated synchronously to avoid retrieving outdated data. This can be achieved using delete or update operations.

In specific operation examples, the cache uses a unique "key name" combination for data storage to ensure uniqueness, along with "expiration time" settings to maintain data timeliness and accuracy.

## Advanced Usage

In more complex application scenarios, it is recommended to use the "transaction" component to manage database and cache operations. By incorporating transactions, data rollback can be achieved to handle operation failures, thereby ensuring data consistency. After an update operation, the old records in the cache should be deleted to ensure that subsequent queries use the latest data.

# Amap

### Overview

Amap integrates Amap controls and route planning features by calling the Amap JS API (https://lbs.amap.com/api/javascript-api/summary) in cases: After setting the default latitude, longitude, and zoom level of the map, it can display the map of this area. The surrounding map can be viewed by mouse, keyboard arrow keys, or finger dragging. The distance between two map markers can be calculated. Route planning can be performed for different transportation tools by latitude and longitude or city address.

### Use Cases

Amap is mainly suitable for the following scenarios:

1. Map Display and Navigation: Display a specific area of the map by setting latitude, longitude, and zoom level.
2. Route Planning: Plan routes for different transportation tools by inputting city addresses or latitude and longitude of the starting and ending points.
3. Location Information Retrieval: Provide information on the user's location or points of interest by obtaining the coordinates or address of the center point.

### Core Features

1. **Map Display**: Display a detailed map of a specified area and support viewing more surrounding areas through mouse, keyboard arrow keys, or finger dragging.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two points marked on the map.
3. **Route Planning**: Support planning routes for various transportation tools (driving, public transit, walking, cycling) by inputting city addresses or latitude and longitude of the starting and ending points.
4. **Map Controls**: Provide a variety of map controls such as scale bars, overview plugins, type switch bars, etc.

### Basic Usage

The basic usage of Amap is similar to the usage of Tencent map components. Detailed instructions can be found in the VisualLogic documentation's Tencent map instructions.

**Specific Operation Steps**:

1. Add a "Route Planning Output Panel" under the "Amap" component.
2. Custom set the id attribute of the route planning output panel, for example, "panel1".
3. Enter the city address or latitude and longitude of the starting and ending points, and the system will automatically display the detailed planned route in the "Route Planning Output Panel".

### Notes

1. The Amap component cannot call actions like "location" or "latitude and longitude to address" when compiled into a webview mini program (only simple map display is supported). It will prompt "page iframe does not support referencing non-business domain names, please reconfigure." This is because WeChat requires the addition of the Amap domain to the mini program business domain, and this operation requires uploading a verification file in the Amap domain backend (Amap does not allow such operations).

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why can't the Amap component call "location" or "latitude and longitude to address" features when compiled into a webview mini program?**
Due to WeChat's requirement that mini program business domain names add Amap's domain name, adding this domain name requires uploading a verification file in the Amap domain backend, which Amap does not allow.

**Can the Amap component be applied to all platforms?**
This component is applicable to both mobile and PC platforms, but the API support varies slightly between platforms. It is recommended to check the Amap API documentation before using.

**Does the Amap component support 3D perspectives?**
Yes, the Amap component view mode attribute can be set to "3D" to display 3D map effects.

### DEMO Preparation Guidance

1. **Map Display and Navigation**: Insert the Amap component, set the latitude and longitude and zoom level to display the map of a specific area. In actual applications, more surrounding areas can be viewed by dragging the map.
2. **Route Planning Feature**: Add a route planning output panel under the Amap component, input the start and end points, and plan the detailed route via the Amap API, displaying it in the output panel.
3. **Event Handling**: Add various events (e.g., click, double-click, drag) to the map to respond to user operations and enhance the interactive experience."
# Android SDK

## Overview

The VisualLogic system's Android SDK functionality aims to encapsulate the application as local resources in the form of a webview and provide various JS interfaces at the native layer to extend the webview's capabilities. The Android applications currently released by VisualLogic are implemented this way. Beyond the basic functions of VisualLogic, users can extend native Java layer functionalities by uploading custom SDKs, such as integrating new Bluetooth protocols or front-end SDKs of third-party applications. This extension method provides users with great flexibility and opportunities for functionality expansion.

## SDK Usage Process

To use the Android SDK, you first need to upload the SDK to the "SDK Resources" in VisualLogic's editor. Note that the Android SDK must be a zip file containing Java code and written according to specified structures and standards. Therefore, utilizing these features requires a certain level of native Android development skills. Not all third-party SDKs can be directly uploaded and compiled.

After uploading, you can select an uploaded SDK from the "SDK" entry in the front end, allowing you to use it in the application. The usage method is similar to the API component, i.e., configuring the corresponding calls and parameters. Only one Android SDK can be added to an application, and if multiple module functionalities are required, they need to be included in the SDK package simultaneously.

## SDK File Writing Specifications

In the SDK resource details interface, users can add front-end SDK resources. If you need to debug or examine the SDK's functional structure, you can download a template for debugging. This involves decompressing the downloaded zip file and opening it in Android Studio for debugging. The key modification location is in `IvxExtApp/extlib/src/main/java/cn/ivx/extlib`.

1. **Adding SDK Functional Entry**: Add SDK methods in `IvxExtRouter.java`; only the relevant methods need to be modified within this file.
2. **Writing Specific Functions**: Refer to the implementation in `HelloHandler.java`, where the entry point for calling functions is the overridden Handle method.
3. **Writing SDK Callback Methods**: To receive specified messages or perform timed communication callbacks, use `this.callback.HandleEvent(String eventName, String params)` in `IvxExtRouter`.
4. **Invoking SDK Callback Methods**: Use the `routeInner` method of `IvxExtRouter` for in-app callbacks.
5. **Listening to Callback Messages**: Currently, you can listen to SDK callback messages by registering custom functions.

Finally, you can package the SDK library in the root directory of the test shell application. The generated `extlib.zip` file can be used for further debugging and uploading.

## Notes

- Ensure that you possess knowledge and skills in native Android development before use, as SDK writing and packaging have strict structures and standards.
- When uploading the SDK, only the compiled `extlib.zip` file needs to be uploaded, without requiring other files.

# java SDK

## Overview

Java SDK is used to extend the backend service of VisualLogic. Users can directly upload their existing Java code packages to the VisualLogic cloud platform for execution. When previewing applications and deploying to a public cloud platform, the code runs on the cloud platform's function computing service; in private deployments, the code runs in the user's own Java runtime environment.

## Usage Scenarios

Java SDK is suitable for scenarios that require extending VisualLogic platform services. Users can upload Java code packages to implement customized functions and call these functions within applications.

## Core Functions

The core functionality of the Java SDK lies in its ease of use and extensibility, allowing users to run custom Java code on the VisualLogic platform to achieve specific functions, and facilitating easy updates and debugging.

## Basic Usage

### SDK Usage Process

1. **Purchase Image**: Purchase an image in the "SDK Resources" section of the editor interface. The image space is storage space provided by the platform, available only on a paid basis, supporting monthly or daily payments.
2. **Upload Image**: After purchasing the image space, upload the corresponding image file. The image is a zip file of the corresponding language, which needs to be written and uploaded according to the specified structure.
3. **Add Image**: After the upload is complete, select the image in the "SDK Resources" section and add it to the backend to use it in the application, similar to an API component.

### SDK File Writing Specifications

1. **Download Template**: Download the template debug shell application in the editor.
2. **Debug**: Open the java folder locally for compiling and debugging, and test by executing `./gradlew run`.
3. **Write Functions**: Add SDK methods in `Route.java` and write specific functions in `HelloHandler.java`.
4. **Package and Upload**: Use the command `./gradlew packageZip` to package, and upload the generated `java.zip` to the VisualLogic cloud platform.

### Private Deployment Java SDK

1. Unzip the downloaded Java SDK package to the server, and run `./gradlew run`.
2. Configure `gradlew run` for persistent service operation, and edit the `gradleapp.service` file.
3. Package `java.zip` and upload it to the "SDK Resources" section of the VisualLogic editor.
4. Fill in the image ID in the `config.json` configuration file to call the service.

## Properties

| Property Name   | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Image Id        | None        |
| Expiration Time | None        |

## Actions

| Action Name        | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Call Custom Method | Describes the method name and required parameters |

## Events

No event-related data at this time.

## Extraction Notes

When uploading SDK files, you only need to upload the final compiled `java.zip` package. Image resources cannot be called across accounts and SDK must be manually replaced with your own resources.

## Extended Reading

You can refer to the online documentation and cases of Java SDK. It is recommended that users check the demo download address provided by the VisualLogic platform: [https://www.ivx.cn/ih5/app/template/download?id=4751](https://www.ivx.cn/ih5/app/template/download?id=4751) for learning and practice."
# js SDK

## Overview

In addition to the functionalities encapsulated by the VisualLogic system, many third-party platform interfaces use SDKs, including node.js versions of the interfaces. The platform provides a mirror space to store user-uploaded SDKs, allowing users to call these SDKs in the editor to extend the functionality of the node.js layer.

## SDK Usage Process

When using node.js SDKs, they are collectively referred to as mirrors. Users must first purchase mirror space in the editor's SDK resources, which is storage space provided by the platform and can only be accessed through payment. Currently, payment is supported on a monthly or daily basis. After the validity period expires, the mirror will be unusable and enter a buffer period. Payment during the buffer period can restore usage; otherwise, it will be completely invalid.

After purchasing mirror space, you can upload mirrors. The mirror is actually a zip file for the corresponding language and needs to be written following a certain structure and specifications. Therefore, users or teams need to have a certain level of native language development capability to upload and use the mirror function.

Once uploaded, you can select a mirror in "SDK Resources" and add it to the backend, then use it in the application similarly to an API component.

## SDK File Writing Specifications

1. **Download Shell Application**:
   - In the SDK mirror purchase interface of the editor, click the template format to download the template debugging shell application.
   - In the mirror details interface of the backend, you can also download the debugging shell application.
   - After unzipping the downloaded archive, the js folder as a whole is the shell application for SDK debugging.

2. **Local Debugging and Packaging**:
   - Install dependencies: `npm i`
   - Generate the src/func.js file: `npm run map`
   - Start the local debugging server: `npm run dev`
   - Use postman to send requests for local validation: POST request to http://localhost:8810, input example `{"fn": "hello"}`, returns `Hello World`.
   - Package and compress the SDK file: `npm run pack`
   - After successful packaging, a pack.zip archive is generated. Only this archive is needed when uploading the SDK.

## Integration Example of Third-Party SDK

Taking Tencent Cloud's Machine Translation SDK as an example:

1. Install the Tencent Cloud SDK: `npm install tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs --save`
2. Create src/tcapi/tmt/textTranslate.func.js file
3. Update the src/func.js file: `npm run map`
4. Start the local debugging server: `npm run dev`
5. Use postman for local interface validation
6. Package and upload the SDK file, select and add the SDK mirror in the editor
7. Debug the service to verify if it is successful

## JSSDK Private Deployment

For private deployment, install npm and node.js on the server first. Here we take the Tencent Machine Translation SDK as an example:

- Follow the steps to download, unzip, install, and debug.
- Install the PM2 process manager to ensure the SDK runs continuously in the backend.
- Configure the config.json file to add the extmap field, which indicates the mirror ID.

This process provides a foundational guarantee for a private deployment case, ensuring that the SDK can be successfully called on a private server.

## Properties

| Property Name   | Content |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Mirror ID       | None    |
| Expiration Time | None    |

## Actions

| Action Name        | Content |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| Call Custom Method | None    |

## Section 5: Extraction Notes

When uploading the SDK file, only the pack.zip archive needs to be uploaded. Make sure to verify the correctness and completeness of the uploaded file.

## Further Reading

# Server File

## Overview

Server File is used to initiate file upload operations in backend services. As the current VisualLogic service does not yet support receiving file object types as parameters, this interface mainly supports three types of uploads: text, base64 encoded resources, and URL files. Each method has its own applications and advantages, aiming to improve storage and usage efficiency while saving database resources and traffic.

## Use Cases

1. **Text Type**: Automatically upload the text as a text file, suitable for storing large segments of text. Compared to storing text directly in the database, uploading it as a file is more efficient and saves database resources. After uploading, the returned file URL address can be stored in the database for future use.

2. **Base64 Type**: Supports uploading Base64 encoded images, videos, and other resources as files. This method allows the encoded data to be directly saved as a file, making it more convenient to use.

3. **URL Type**: Allows multiple external URL addresses to be directly uploaded to VisualLogic's file service, which is particularly suitable for scenarios involving bulk external resource processing.

## Core Functions

- **Text Upload**: Automatically generates a txt file from a segment of text content for storage. This is useful for large data storage without consuming database performance.
  
- **Base64 Resource Upload**: Uploads and generates a file based on the Base64 encoding of the file content combined with a specified file extension.

- **URL File Upload**: Uploads one or more specified URLs to the backend file system for centralized management.

## Basic Usage

### Text Upload Example

When uploading text, specify a text content (e.g., "aaa") and execute the upload operation. From the result, retrieve the detailed information of the uploaded file from the "file information". The file name can be used for file download operations on the front end, with the steps as follows:

#### Text File Upload Procedure
```mermaid
graph LR;
A[Start] --> B[Specify Text]
B --> C[Execute Upload]
C --> D{Success}
D -->|Yes| E[Retrieve File Information]
E --> F[Return File Name]
D -->|No| G[Show Error Message]
```

### Base64 Resource Upload Example

To upload a Base64 resource, specify the Base64 string and file extension. After uploading, the returned file information can be used for display or download on the front end.

#### Base64 Resource Upload Procedure
```mermaid
graph LR;
A[Start] --> B[Specify Base64 String]
B --> C[Specify File Extension]
C --> D[Execute Upload]
D --> E{Success}
E -->|Yes| F[Retrieve File Information]
F --> G[Input to Frontend Component]
E -->|No| H[Show Error Message]
```

## Actions

| Action Name            | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upload Text to File    | Upload text as a txt file, suitable for storing large amounts of data |
| Upload Base64 Resource | Upload Base64 encoded content to a file, supporting multiple formats like images, PDFs, etc. |
| Upload File URL        | Specify an array of URLs to upload to the backend file system |

## Further Reading

When using the Server File interface, it is necessary to choose the appropriate upload method based on specific business scenarios. This interface improves resource utilization efficiency when handling file storage. It is recommended to integrate with VisualLogic's frontend component interface to achieve a complete process from upload to display. For specific usage cases, refer to VisualLogic platform tutorials and example projects."
# MQTT component

## Overview

The MQTT component establishes a connection based on WebSocket and communicates using the MQTT protocol over this channel. This communication mode is referred to as MQTT over WebSocket. The component supports two types of connections: ws (standard WebSocket connection) and wss (WebSocket connection with TLS encryption).

## Use Cases

The MQTT component is often used in scenarios requiring real-time message publication and subscription, achieving instant communication between devices through efficient message transmission. It's suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, online chat applications, and other scenarios requiring low-latency, reliable communication.

## Core Functions

1. **Connection Address**: Configure the MQTT access address, usually provided by the server.
2. **Client ID**: Each client's ID needs to be unique and can be customized.
3. **Username and Password**: Optional; only required if the server mandates it.
4. **Offline Message Topic and Content**: When the client disconnects, the server will automatically send a message to a specified topic, and other online devices subscribed to that topic will receive it.

## Basic Usage

### Connecting to an MQTT Server

Connecting to an MQTT server requires configuring the connection address and the client ID. This can be set directly in the VisualLogic editor, ensuring the uniqueness of the client ID.

#### Steps

1. Enter the VisualLogic editor and select the MQTT component.

2. **Component Configuration**: In the property panel, set "Control Management Mode" to "Video Component" to manage the RTSP player holistically.

### Advanced Usage

#### Multi-stream Playback Optimization

To address memory leak issues in the Chromium kernel, configure via the following steps:

1. **Ngx Configuration**:
   - In the streamDecoder software package, edit the `nginx.conf` file to open an HTTP port locally and reverse proxy it to the VisualLogic playback page.
   - Start streamDecoder.exe or use runProxy.bat to start the proxy. Ensure the browser can display the playback page content correctly via http://localhost:local-port/playback-path, indicating a successful proxy configuration.

2. **Control Management Case Setup**:
   - Create a new case (or integrate control management into the existing system) and configure the control component:
     - Set the control management mode to "Playback Page".
     - Set the URL of the multi-stream playback case to the previously configured local nginx reverse proxy path.
     - Define inspection timings and maximum continuous playback time. For instance, check at 00:00, 08:00, and 16:00 daily if the playback page has been running for more than 8 hours. If exceeded, reload the page.

3. **Playback Window Management**:
   - If not using pop-up playback, disable the "Pop-up Window Playback" switch and use a web component.
   - Configure the "Cleaning Reminder Event" in the control event panel to customize reloading logic. It is recommended to set a delay during reloading to prevent some browsers from failing to load.

4. **Logic Entry Configuration**:

# Word Online Editing

### Overview

Word is a component in VisualLogic used for online processing of ".doc/.docx" documents. Using the Word component, we can preview documents online, edit them, and after completing the editing, download the document locally or save it to the cloud.

### Use Cases

In business scenarios where online collaboration, preview, and management of Word documents are needed, the Word online editing component of VisualLogic can be adopted. For example, online editing and management of team project documents, synchronous grading of online homework, or real-time meeting minutes.

### Core Features

#### Add Word Component

- It should be noted that under the same case, only one Office component (Word/Excel/PPT) can be rendered at a time. Multiple Office components rendering together will cause conflicts. For Office components that are not needed, they should be hidden using the IF container.

#### Basic Interface

- After adding the Word component, set a parent container for it. Once the case is opened, the component will automatically render the editing area.
- After the editing area is rendered, the buttons at the top of the editing area are fixed. Custom buttons can be created using the banner component to fit specific business scenarios.
- Once the editing area is rendered, the Word document can be edited. The basic operations are similar to those of Microsoft Office, and the generated files perfectly support Microsoft Office.

#### Upload Document

- When uploading documents, use the file interface to upload the document. When needed, open the pre-uploaded document using the Office component for editing.
- After uploading, two important values need to be stored for subsequent online editing: the "txt path" and the "resource parsing path".
- Note that when uploading documents via the file interface, the txt path and resource parsing path need to be saved. Before rendering the editing page with the Office component, set the resource parsing path so that resources in the document can display correctly.

#### Save File

- Trigger saving by clicking the "Save button" at the top left of the Word editor, or by calling the Office component's "Save document data" action.
- After successful saving, the Office component will respond with a save data event. The saved data can be retrieved for subsequent storage logic.
- Note that the file data saved by the Office component may be too large. When stored directly in a database text field or JSON field, it might get truncated. Therefore, the data saved by the Office component should be uploaded to the server and stored as a txt file.

#### Open Document

- The document can be opened and edited in real-time using the txt data saved in the previous step.
  * First step, retrieve the document txt address from the database.
  * Second step, get the temporary file address using the txt address.
  * Third step, get the document source data using the temporary file address with an API Get request (note the returned result value.data).
  * Fourth step, use the Word component's "Open document data" action to render the page. If the resource parsing path exists, set the resource parsing path beforehand.

#### Download File

- By calling the Word component's "Download file" action, the current edited content can be downloaded locally.

# Hyperlink

# Hyperlink Technical Documentation

## Overview

In VisualLogic, the hyperlink component is used to add hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to other UI components. This component can specify the hyperlink's URL address and target window, allowing for navigation within web pages or applications. In VisualLogic, external link navigation can be achieved through two methods: one is via the stage's open external link action, and the other is by adding a hyperlink to the component. Both methods can be used to open external links but have their own advantages. The open external link action can be triggered by any event (e.g., page initialization); whereas hyperlinks can only be triggered by clicks, but they are beneficial for web application SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For applications requiring SEO, it is recommended to use hyperlinks for internal navigation so that crawlers can capture more pages through `<a>` tags.

## Use Cases

The hyperlink component is mainly used for navigation and SEO optimization in web applications. By adding hyperlinks to text, images, icons, or button components, navigation to specific pages or resources from the user interface is achieved. It is suitable for web applications that require efficient navigation capabilities while also needing to enhance search engine visibility.

## Core Functions

The hyperlink component can add hyperlink functionality to text, images, icons, and buttons. Additionally, users can define the link address and target window to determine the hyperlink's behavior.

- **Link Address**: It can be an absolute address (e.g., `https://www.google.com`) or a relative address (e.g., `?a=1`).
- **Target Window**: The link can open in the current window, a new tab, the parent window, or the top window.

## Basic Usage

In VisualLogic, hyperlinks can be used in the following components: text, images, icons, and buttons. Within the hyperlink component, users can specify the link address and target window.

For example, here is a typical way to set a hyperlink:

- Absolute address example: `https://www.example.com`
- Relative address example: `?page=home`

For relative addresses, page navigation will not cause a page refresh.

## Properties

| Property Name       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Link Address        | The URL address of the link, which can be a full URL like `https://www.google.com`, or a relative address like `?a=1` |
| Target Window       | The setting for the target window of the link, which can be opened in the current window, a new tab, parent window, or top window |
| Do Not Refresh Page | When navigating to the same address with only different parameters, the option can be chosen to not refresh the page |

## Extraction Notes

- When using an absolute address, ensure the URL's accuracy and accessibility.
- When setting the target window, reasonably select the corresponding window option based on user experience, such as opening internal links in the same page and external links in a new window.

Through the VisualLogic hyperlink component, users can easily achieve efficient page navigation and enhance the SEO effect of their applications. The use of the hyperlink component not only improves the navigation experience for users but also simplifies complex link management."

# Message Queue

## Overview

Message queues are primarily used for request peak shaving in high-concurrency scenarios. When a large number of service requests pour in at once, to avoid overwhelming the backend services, the requests can be queued, and processed one by one only after the previous request is handled. This prevents service crashes. In the direct request mode, all requests go directly to the business server. If the request volume is too high, it may cause server crashes. In the message queue mode, all requests first enter the queue, and are then processed by the business server in order. While this increases the request wait time, it ensures the server runs healthily.

## Use Cases

Message queues are suitable for request peak shaving in high-concurrency scenarios. For example, when an application receives a large number of requests simultaneously during peak hours, it can use a message queue to queue these requests for processing. This smooths out the traffic, alleviates server stress, and maintains service stability.

## Core Functions

- **Message Structure Definition**: Before sending a message, users can define the internal JSON structure of the message and fill in specific message content based on this structure.
- **Message Sending**: The message sending service is an external interface responsible for converting business requests into messages and enqueueing them.
- **Message Processing**: After sending a message, the system needs to process the received message. The processing logic primarily occurs in message queue events, such as storing the message content in cache for further processing.

## Basic Usage

### Adding Message Queue

Users can add a message queue component in the Server File and predefine message content structure fields. The definition of the message structure is crucial, failing which the message content cannot be referenced upon receipt.

### Sending Messages to the Queue

The message sending service is the business entry point invoked by the client. This service converts received requests into messages and sends them to the message queue, only responsible for queuing the requests. Specific business processing is completed by the service within the queue.

## Advanced Usage

### Viewing Logs

To view message processing logs, users can click the log button of the message queue. The logging feature helps troubleshoot issues during message transmission and processing.

### Cloud Computing Costs and Private Deployment

In the online environment, message queues are charged per message. For specific costs, refer to the cloud computing cost page. In private deployment, Redis is used by default unless otherwise specified. However, when handling large volumes of messages, it is recommended to configure an independent Rabbit MQ or Rocket MQ and specify the MQ address in the private configuration file.

# Integer

## Overview

An integer variable is a type of variable used to store integers. Its characteristic is that even if it is assigned a floating-point number, it will automatically be rounded down. For example, assigning a value of 3.8 to an integer variable and then printing its value will yield 3. Therefore, integer variables are very useful in scenarios where precise integer values are required and decimals are not allowed.

## Application Scenarios

Integer variables are often used in various computational scenarios requiring integer data. For example, counters and indexes can use integer variables. Unlike general numerical variables, integer variables inherently have the property of rounding down, making them particularly suitable for applications where the decimal part needs to be discarded and integer processing is required.

## Core Functions

Integer variables are fundamentally similar to numerical variables in data storage but are unique in that they can automatically handle non-integer string inputs and round them down. Moreover, they can be bound with formulas and events, possess basic computational abilities like addition and subtraction, and can generate random integers, providing developers with great flexibility.

## Basic Usage

### Assignment

In the edit mode, developers can directly input the initial value in the "value" field of the integer variable's properties. If no initial value is set, the default value is 0. The value of an integer variable can be assigned through binding formulas or in the event panel. If a decimal is assigned to an integer variable, it will automatically be rounded down.

### Operations

Integer variables support various operations, including but not limited to:

- **Add 1/Subtract 1**: Convenient for simple increment or decrement operations.
- **Generate Random Integer**: It can generate a random integer within a specified range and store it in the variable.

These operational methods allow developers to perform dynamic mathematical computations on data simply to meet different business needs.

## Advanced Usage

The methods of integer variables can be used to achieve complex functions, such as counting the occurrences of specific events. By binding integer variables with events, the value of the integer variable can be automatically adjusted when the event is triggered, thereby tracking and recording specified behaviors.

## Properties

| Property Name | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Value         | The current value of the integer variable |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Print Current Value     | Calls the console to dynamically output the current value of the integer variable |
| Assign                  | Assigns a value to the variable, automatically rounding down |
| Add 1                   | Adds 1 to the current stored value of the integer variable   |
| Subtract 1              | Subtracts 1 from the current stored value of the integer variable |
| Add N                   | Adds N to the current stored value of the integer variable   |
| Subtract N              | Subtracts N from the current stored value of the integer variable |
| Generate Random Integer | Generates a random integer within a specified range and stores it |

## Events

| Event Name  | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Change | Triggered when the variable data changes and only triggers once |

## Extraction Notes

- The assignment operation to integer variables will automatically round down. Please consider whether this is suitable in applications requiring high numerical precision.
- When binding formulas, ensure the formula's output is a numerical value, as non-numerical results may lead to abnormal operations.

## Further Reading

- Application development examples of integer variables in counting, statistics, and indexing scenarios.

# Database View 5.0

### Overview

Database views are purely logical components, divided into single-table and multi-table views. VisualLogic editor version 5.0 has upgraded the view components. Essentially, a database view stores the mapping and join relationships of a database. When used as a single table, it can be understood as a virtual database that allows for data addition, deletion, modification, and querying as target operations; when used as multiple tables, it serves as a visual editing interface for join operations, enabling multi-table data joint query and statistical output.

The most important feature of database views is the ability to replace the data source in the attribute panel, enabling the reuse of the same database logic in multiple cases. You can encapsulate the database view in a code snippet or directly copy it to another case. In the new case, you can directly replace the data source, bind new database fields, and avoid the need to rewrite the database view logic.

### Usage Scenarios

Using database views in VisualLogic to address multi-table join query scenarios. Databases designed with mySQL split data into many tables, each table storing different data while being associated with foreign keys, aiming to reduce the repetition of the same field in different tables. This leads to the use of a very important method in querying relational databases: join queries, which associate different tables through a certain field to complete the query.

### Core Functionality

1. **Single-Table View**: Functions as a virtual database for data addition, deletion, modification, and querying. Its flexibility is evident in the ability to add or remove fields in the backend object tree, adjusting the display order and type of the data as needed.
2. **Multi-Table View**: Provides view join functionalities, allowing users to set join relationships between multiple data tables in the backend and execute join queries through component methods.

### Basic Usage

#### Single-Table View Usage

The usage of single-table views is similar to operating a database, using the database view component to simulate a virtual database. Here are the basic usage steps:

- **Add Database View Component**: In the backend component panel, find the database view component, drag it to the object tree, and confirm it in the tree structure.
- **Add Data Source**: Click on the attribute panel of the data view, select the data source option to add a new data source, and configure the data source by adjusting the field names and types in the attribute panel.
- **Set Fields**: Add appropriate fields and data types to the database view, injecting necessary field descriptions for others to understand.

#### Multi-Table View Usage

For multi-table views, users need to understand how to achieve multi-table join queries through database views. Specific methods are as follows:

- **Create Database Structure**: First create multiple relevant database tables, output the required data tables, and associate common foreign keys in the backend.
- **Add Database View Component**: Load the database view component in the object tree and select the data source for configuration.
- **Set Data Source and Join Relationships**: Set the join relationships between fields through the settings in the attribute panel.
- **Output Database Data**: Use the component to directly output the newly generated joined tables for frontend display or further analysis.

### Advanced Usage

#### Reuse of Database Views

Database views can be logically copied across cases, simply by binding a new data source in the new case to achieve logic reuse. Operation steps:

- **Cross-Case Copying**: Select the database view and service in the object tree for cross-case copying operations.
- **Onsite Adjustment**: Adjust the data source in the new case to match the new database requirements, ensuring the logic and attributes remain consistent.

### Three Types of Joins

Join methods typically include inner join, left join, and right join, selectable in the settings panel:

- **Inner Join**: Merges only the shared information between the two tables.
- **Left Join**: Ensures the integrity of the left table data, even if the right table has no corresponding data.
- **Right Join**: Ensures the integrity of the right table data, even if the left table has no corresponding data.

# Event Bus

## Overview

Event channels can be understood as a frontend WebSocket. All applications with an added event channel can communicate with each other through this channel. By adding an event channel component and selecting or creating a configured channel, various applications can send and receive messages to and from each other. Event channels are primarily used to enable inter-application communication within the current client's browser and do not involve backend services.

## Core Features

### 1. Sending and Receiving Messages

- **Sending Messages**: The "Send Message" feature allows you to send a message to a specified event channel. Other sub-applications or code modules connecting to the same event channel can receive this message.
- **Receiving Messages**: In the event bus, you can listen for and receive messages in the current channel. Both the main application and sub-applications can achieve message passing as long as they use the same event bus.

### 2. Message Structure

The message structure of an event channel can be predefined. Once defined, this structure can be directly used during message sending and receiving, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of message delivery.

## Basic Methods

### 1. Waiting for Messages

- **Wait for Message Action**: This feature will block the event execution flow until the first message is received in the current event channel. This method is often used to replace custom callback functions to achieve asynchronous actions. By waiting for messages in the event channel, and continuing with subsequent action sets upon message arrival, the effect of asynchronous execution can be simulated.

## Considerations

- Communication through event channels is a purely frontend communication method on the client-side. It is crucial to ensure that the communicating applications are loaded simultaneously in a micro frontend system to ensure effective communication.
- Communication is only effective within the local browser client and cannot be used for communication between different clients.

Through proper setting and usage of event channels, we can achieve an efficient and flexible message-passing mechanism within applications, enhancing the interactivity and response efficiency of the applications."
# Promise

# Overview

The Waiter is a component applied to event control that can halt execution at a pause node when an event arrives, waiting for the trigger of other events to resume execution. This mechanism provides flexible control means for complex event flows, allowing events to synchronize according to specific conditions.

# Use Cases

The Waiter is typically used in scenarios that require waiting for a certain condition or signal, such as tasks that continue execution only after user confirmation or external signal input. This is very useful for achieving rich user interactions and complex event control processes.

# Core Functions

## Start Waiting

Starting wait is the core function of the Waiter. When the event flow reaches the Waiter's pause point, the entire event is paused. Subsequent events then require an external signal or condition to continue execution.

## End Waiting

Ending wait is a crucial function that can be triggered by other events, allowing events halted by the Waiter to continue. Additionally, the end wait action can pass parameters, which can be used by the paused events for subsequent logical processing upon resumption.

# Basic Usage

1. **Add Waiter Component**

   Add the Waiter component to the required event. Implement inter-event communication by configuring the component’s name and parameter structure.

   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
   A[Event Trigger] --> B[Waiter Start Waiting]
   B --> C{External Condition Satisfied}
   C -->|Yes| D[Trigger End Waiting and Continue]
   ```

2. **Configure the Waiter**

   Configure the name and parameter structure of the Waiter. These configurations will affect the pause state and subsequent event linkage upon resumption.

3. **Demo**

   A specific application example is designing an event flow via the Waiter that continues execution after waiting for user confirmation in another event. This ensures user engagement in the process and the safety of operations.
